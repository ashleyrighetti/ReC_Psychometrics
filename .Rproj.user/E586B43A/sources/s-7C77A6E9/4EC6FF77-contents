SCREENCAST LINK:  https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9b46c34c-6333-4b05-a66e-aabc00012cf0
about 5 minutes

Essentially you will be

* Formatting a survey on Qualtrics using all the best practices identified in the lecture
  + these include having an introductory statement (to include statement of confidentiality), directions for each sub-survey (if more than one), and closing statement.
  + selecting the most appropriate question type for the items.  For example, matrix instead of multiple choice. 
  + within question type, using the appropriate options for proper formatting (e.g., the anchors in a matrix should be topically consistent and equal-interval)
* The survey should include minimum of 3 of the qualTRIXter skills (identified in lecture); choose from
  + establishing collaboration
  + scheduling e-mail distribution and follow-up
  + personalizing the survey in some way
  + randomization of blocks or items
  + integrating display, skip, or branch logic (e.g., having males and females take a different route)
  + exporting the survey to Word
  + recoding variables in the item controls
  + anonymize the responses
  + prevent ballot box stuffing
  + include a progress bar
  + create a custom ending, e-mail, or thank-you note
  + something else that YOU discovered that isn't in the lecture
* Piloting it, getting their feedback, and identifying what problems are (and how you might fix them)
  + with 3 folks from your RVT, cohort, or this class
  + with 3 additional folks who aren't quite as "research savvy"
  + collect their feedback (ideally in a text-item directly on the survey itself) and write a brief summary (3 paragraphs max) of their impressions and how you might improve the survey
* Import the Qualtrics data directly R 
  + preferably, directly from Qualtrics with the API token, base URL, and survey ID
  + alternatively (for the same # of points) from the exported CSV file *via the qualtRics package* (required)
