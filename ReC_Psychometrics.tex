\textbf{If you are viewing this document, you should know that this is a book-in-progress. Early drafts are released for the purpose teaching my classes and gaining formative feedback from a host of stakeholders. The document was last updated on 07 Sep 2021}. Emerging volumes on other statistics are posted on the \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/BikosRVT/ReCenter.html}{ReCentering Psych Stats} page at my research team's website.

\href{https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c932455e-ef06-444a-bdca-acf7012d759a}{Screencasted Lecture Link}

To \emph{center} a variable in regression means to set its value at zero and interpret all other values in relation to this reference point. Regarding race and gender, researchers often center male and White at zero. Further, it is typical that research vignettes in statistics textbooks are similarly seated in a White, Western (frequently U.S.), heteronormative, framework. The purpose of this project is to create a set of open educational resources (OER) appropriate for doctoral and post-doctoral training that contribute to a socially responsive pedagogy -- that is, it contributes to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.

Statistics training in doctoral programs are frequently taught with fee-for-use programs (e.g., SPSS/AMOS, SAS, MPlus) that may not be readily available to the post-doctoral professional. In recent years, there has been an increase and improvement in R packages (e.g., \emph{psych}, \emph{lavaan}) used for in analyses common to psychological research. Correspondingly, many graduate programs are transitioning to statistics training in R (free and open source). This is a challenge for post-doctoral psychologists who were trained with other software. This OER will offer statistics training with R and be freely available (specifically in a GitHub respository and posted through GitHub Pages) under a Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike license {[}CC BY-NC-SA 4.0{]}.

Training models for doctoral programs in HSP are commonly scholar-practitioner, scientist-practitioner, or clinical-scientist. An emerging model, the \emph{scientist-practitioner-advocacy} training model incorporates social justice advocacy so that graduates are equipped to recognize and address the sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities \citep{mallinckrodt_scientist-practitioner-advocate_2014}. In statistics textbooks, the use of research vignettes engages the learner around a tangible scenario for identifying independent variables, dependent variables, covariates, and potential mechanisms of change. Many students recall examples in Field's \citeyearpar{field_discovering_2012} popular statistics text: Viagra to teach one-way ANOVA, beer goggles for two-way ANOVA, and bushtucker for repeated measures. What if the research vignettes were more socially responsive?

In this OER, research vignettes will be from recently published articles where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC{[}low-middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research is responsive to issues of justice, equity, inclusion, diversity,
\item
  the lesson's statistic is used in the article, and
\item
  there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or it is publicly available.
\end{itemize}

In training for multicultural competence, the saying, ``A fish doesn't know that it's wet'' is often used to convey the notion that we are often unaware of our own cultural characteristics. In recent months and years, there has been an increased awakening to the institutional and systemic racism that our systems are perpetuating. Queuing from the water metaphor, I am hopeful that a text that is recentered in the ways I have described can contribute to \emph{changing the water} in higher education and in the profession of psychology.

As a doctoral student at the University of Kansas (1992-2005), I learned that ``a foreign language'' was required for graduation. \emph{Please note that as one who studies the intersections of global, vocational, and sustainable psychology, I regret that I do not have language skills beyond English.} This could have been met with credit from high school my rural, mid-Missouri high school did not offer such classes. This requirement would have typically been met with courses taken during an undergraduate program -- but my non-teaching degree in the University of Missouri's School of Education was exempt from this. The requirement could have also been met with a computer language (fortran, C++) -- I did not have any of those either. There was a tiny footnote on my doctoral degree plan that indicated that a 2-credit course, ``SPSS for Windows'' would substitute for the language requirement. Given that it was taught by my one of my favorite professors, I readily signed up. As it turns out, Samuel B. Green, PhD, was using the course to draft chapters in the textbook \citep{green_using_2014} that has been so helpful for so many. Unfortunately, Drs. Green (1947 - 2018) and Salkind (2947 - 2017) are no longer with us. I have worn out numerous versions of their text. Another favorite text of mine was Dr.~Barbara Byrne's \citeyearpar{byrne_structural_2016}, ``Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS.'' I loved the way she worked through each problem and paired it with a published journal article, so that the user could see how the statistical evaluation fit within the larger project/article. I took my tea-stained text with me to a workshop she taught at APA and was proud of the signature she added to it (a little catfur might have fallen out). Dr.~Byrne created SEM texts for a number of statistical programs (e.g., LISREL, EQS, MPlus). As I was learning R, I wrote Dr.~Byrne, asking if she had an edition teaching SEM/CFA with R. She promptly wrote back, saying that she did not have the bandwidth to learn a new statistics package. We lost Dr.~Byrne in December 2020. I am so grateful to these role models for their contributions to my statistical training. I am also grateful for the doctoral students who have taken my courses and are continuing to provide input for how to improve the materials.

The inspiration for training materials that re*center statistics and research methods came from the \href{https://www.academics4blacklives.com/}{Academics for Black Survival and Wellness Initiative}. This project, co-founded by Della V. Mosley, Ph.D., and Pearis L. Bellamy, M.S., made clear the necessity and urgency for change in higher education and the profession of psychology.

At very practical levels, I am indebted to SPU's Library, and more specifically, SPU's Education, Technology, and Media Department. Assistant Dean for Instructional Design and Emerging Technologies, R. John Robertson, MSc, MCS, has offered unlimited consultation, support, and connection. Senior Instructional Designer in Graphics \& Illustrations, Dominic Wilkinson, designed the logo and bookcover. Psychology and Scholarly Communications Librarian, Kristin Hoffman, MLIS, has provided consultation on topics ranging from OERS to citations. I am alo indebted to Associate Vice President, Teaching and Learning at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Rajiv Jhangiani, PhD. Dr.~Jhangiani's text \citeyearpar{jhangiani_research_2019} was the first OER I ever used and I was grateful for his encouraging conversation.

Financial support for this text has been provided from the \emph{Call to Action on Equity, Inclusion, Diversity, Justice, and Social Responsivity
Request for Proposals} grant from the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (2021-2022).

\hypertarget{what-to-expect-in-each-chapter}{%
\section{What to expect in each chapter}\label{what-to-expect-in-each-chapter}}

This textbook is intended as \emph{applied,} in that a primary goal is to help the scientist-practitioner-advocate use a variety of statistics in research problems and \emph{writing them up} for a program evaluation, dissertation, or journal article. In support of that goal, I try to provide just enough conceptual information so that the researcher can select the appropriate statistic (i.e., distinguishing between when ANOVA is appropriate and when regression is appropriate) and assign variables to their proper role (e.g., covariate, moderator, mediator).

This conceptual approach does include occasional, step-by-step, \emph{hand-calculations} (only we calculate them arithmetically in R) to provide a \emph{visceral feeling} of what is happening within the statistical algorithm that may be invisible to the researcher. Additionally, the conceptual review includes a review of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data and research design that are required for the statistic. Statistics can be daunting, so I have worked hard to establish a \emph{workflow} through each analysis. When possible, I include a flowchart that is referenced frequently in each chapter and assists the the researcher keep track of their place in the many steps and choices that accompany even the simplest of analyses.

As with many statistics texts, each chapter includes a \emph{research vignette.} Somewhat unique to this resource is that the vignettes are selected from recently published articles. Each vignette is chosen with the intent to meet as many of the following criteria as possible:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the statistic that is the focus of the chapter was properly used in the article,
\item
  the author's identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC {[}low middle income countries{]}),
\item
  the research has a justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, and social responsivity focus and will contribute positively to a social justice pedagogy, and
\item
  the data is available in a repository or there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s).
\end{itemize}

In each chapter we employ \emph{R} packages that will efficiently calculate the statistic and the dashboard of metrics (e.g., effect sizes, confidence intervals) that are typically reported in psychological science.

\hypertarget{strategies-for-accessing-and-using-this-oer}{%
\section{Strategies for Accessing and Using this OER}\label{strategies-for-accessing-and-using-this-oer}}

There are a number of ways you can access this resource. You may wish to try several strategies and then select which works best for you. I demonstrate these in the screencast that accompanies this chapter.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Simply follow along in the .html formatted document that is available on via GitHug Pages, and then

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open a fresh .rmd file of your own, copying (or retyping) the script and running it
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Locate the original documents at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_Psychometrics}{GitHub repository} . You can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open them to simply take note of the ``behind the scenes'' script
  \item
    copy/download individual documents that are of interest to you
  \item
    fork a copy of the entire project to your own GitHub site and further download it (in its entirety) to your personal workspace. The \href{https://desktop.github.com/}{GitHub Desktop app} makes this easy!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Listen to the accompanying lectures (I think sound best when the speed is 1.75). The lectures are being recorded in Panopto and should include the closed captioning.
\item
  Provide feedback to me! If you fork a copy to your own GitHub repository, you can

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    open up an editing tool and mark up the document with your edits,
  \item
    start a discussion by leaving comments/questions, and then
  \item
    sending them back to me by committing and saving. I get an e-mail notiying me of this action. I can then review (accepting or rejecting) them and, if a discussion is appropriate, reply back to you.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{if-you-are-new-to-r}{%
\section{If You are New to R}\label{if-you-are-new-to-r}}

R can be oveRwhelming. Jumping right into advanced statistics might not be the easiest way to start. However, in these chapters, I provide complete code for every step of the process, starting with uploading the data. To help explain what R script is doing, I sometimes write it in the chapter text; sometimes leave hastagged-comments in the chunks; and, particularly in the accompanying screencasted lectures, try to take time to narrate what the R script is doing.

I've found that, somewhere on the internet, there's almost always a solution to what I'm trying to do. I am frequently stuck and stumped and have spent hours searching the internet for even the tiniest of things. When you watch my videos, you may notice that in my R studio, there is a ``scRiptuRe'' file. I takes notes on the solutions and scripts here -- using keywords that are meaningful to me so that when I need to repeat the task, I can hopefully search my own prior solutions and find a fix or a hint.

\hypertarget{base-r}{%
\subsection{Base R}\label{base-r}}

The base program is free and is available here: \url{https://www.r-project.org/}

Because R is already on my machine (and because the instructions are sufficient), I will not walk through the instllation, but I will point out a few things.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Follow the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux)
\item
  The ``cran'' (I think ``cranium'') is the \emph{Comprehensive R Archive Network.} In order for R to run on your computer, you have to choose a location. Because proximity is somewhat related to processing speed, select one that is geographically ``close to you.''
\item
  You will see the results of this download on your desktop (or elsewhere if you chose to not have it appear there) but you won't ever use R through this platform.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-studio}{%
\subsection{R Studio}\label{r-studio}}

\emph{R Studio} is the desktop application I work in R. It's a separate download. Choose the free, desktop, option that is appropriate for your operating system: \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Upper right window: Includes several tabs; we frequently monitor the

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Environment: it lists the \emph{objects} that are available to you (e.g., dataframes)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Lower right window: has a number of helpful tabs.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Files: Displays the file structure in your computer's environment. Make it a practice to (a) organize your work in small folders and (b) navigating to that small folder that is holding your project when you are working on it.
  \item
    Packages: Lists the packages that have been installed. If you navigate to it, you can see if it is ``on.'' You can also access information about the package (e.g., available functions, examples of script used with the package) in this menu. This information opens in the Help window.
  \item
    Viewer and Plots are helpful, later, when we can simultaneously look at our output and still work on our script.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Primary window

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    R Studio runs in the background(in the console). Very occasionally, I can find useful troubleshooting information here.
  \item
    More commonly, I open my R Markdown document so that it takes the whole screen and I work directly, right here.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{R Markdown} is the way that many analysts write \emph{script}, conduct analyses, and even write up results. These are saved as .rmd files.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In R Studio, open an R Markdown document through File/New File/R Markdown
  \item
    Specify the details of your document (title, author, desired ouput)
  \item
    In a separate step, SAVE this document (File/Save{]} into a NEW FILE FOLDER that will contain anything else you need for your project (e.g., the data).
  \item
    \emph{Packages} are at the heart of working in R. Installing and activating packages require writing script.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-hygiene}{%
\subsection{R Hygiene}\label{r-hygiene}}

Many initial problems in R can be solved with good R hygiene. Here are some suggestions for basic practices. It can be tempting to ``skip this.'' However, in the first few weeks of class, these are the solutions I am presenting to my students.

\hypertarget{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}{%
\subsubsection{Everything is documented in the .rmd file}\label{everything-is-documented-in-the-.rmd-file}}

Although others do it differently, everything is in my .rmd file. That is, for uploading data and opening packages I write the code in my .rmd file. Why? Because when I read about what I did hours or years later, I have a permanent record of very critical things like (a) where my data is located, (b) what version I was using, and (c) what package was associated with the functions.

\hypertarget{file-organization}{%
\subsubsection{File organization}\label{file-organization}}

File organization is a critical key to this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a project file folder.
\item
  Put the data file in it.
\item
  Open an R Markdown file.
\item
  Save it in the same file folder.
\item
  When your data and .rmd files are in the same folder (not your desktop, but a shared folder), they can be connected.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{chunks}{%
\subsubsection{Chunks}\label{chunks}}

The R Markdown document is an incredible tool for integrating text, tables, and analyses. This entire OER is written in R Markdown. A central feature of this is ``chunks.''

The easiest way to insert a chunk is to use the INSERT/R command at the top of this editor box. You can also insert a chunk with the keyboard shortcut: CTRL/ALT/i

``Chunks'' start and end with with those three tic marks and will show up in a shaded box, like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#hashtags let me write comments to remind myself what I did}
\CommentTok{\#here I am simply demonstrating arithmetic (but I would normally be running code)}
\DecValTok{2021} \SpecialCharTok{{-}} \DecValTok{1966}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 55
\end{verbatim}

Each chunk must open and close. If one or more of your tic marks get deleted, your chunk won't be read as such and your script will not run. The only thing in the chunks should be script for running R; you can hashtag-out script so it won't run.

Although unnecessary, you can add a brief title for the chunk in the opening row, after the ``r.'' These create something of a table of contents of all the chunks -- making it easier to find what you did. You can access them in the ``Chunks'' tab at the bottom left of R Studio. If you wish to knit a document, you cannot have identical chunk titles.

You can put almost anything you want in the space outside of tics. Syntax for simple formatting in the text areas (e.g,. using italics, making headings, bold, etc.) is found here: \url{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html}

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\subsubsection{Packages}\label{packages}}

As scientist-practitioners (and not coders), we will rely on \emph{packages} to do our work for us. At first you may feel overwhelmed about the large number of packages that are available. Soon, though, you will become accustomed to the ones most applicable to our work (e.g., psych, tidyverse, lavaan, apaTables).

Researchers treat packages differently. In these lectures, I list all the packages we will use in an opening chunk that asks R to check to see if the package is installed, and if not, installs it.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(}\SpecialCharTok{!}\FunctionTok{require}\NormalTok{(psych))\{}\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"psych"}\NormalTok{)\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Loading required package: psych
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## Warning: package 'psych' was built under R version 4.0.5
\end{verbatim}

To make a package operable, you need to open it through the library. This process must be repeated each time you restart R. I don't open the package (through the ``library(package\_name)'') command until it is time to use it. Especially for new users, I think it's important to connect the functions with the specific packages.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#install.packages ("psych")}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{ (psych)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you type in your own ``install.packages'' code, hashtag it out once it's been installed. It is problematic to continue to re-run this code .

\hypertarget{knitting}{%
\subsubsection{Knitting}\label{knitting}}

Hiccups are normal. Here are some ideas that I have found useful in getting unstuck.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In an R script, you must have everything in order -- Every. Single. Time.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    All the packages have to be in your library and activated; if you restart R, you need to reload each package.
  \item
    If you open an .rmd file and want a boxplot, you cannot just scroll down to that script. You need to run any \emph{prerequisite} script (like loading the package, importing data, putting the data in the global environment, etc.)
  \item
    Do you feel lost? clear your global environment (broom) and start at the top of the R script. Frequent, fresh starts are good.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Your .rmd file and your data need to be stored in the same file folder. These should be separate for separate projects, no matter how small.
\item
  Type any warnings you get into a search engine. Odds are, you'll get some decent hints in a manner of seconds. Especially at first, these are common errors:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The package isn't loaded (if you restarted R, you need to reload your packages)
  \item
    The .rmd file has been saved yet, or isn't saved in the same folder as the data
  \item
    Errors of punctuation or spelling
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Restart R (it's quick -- not like restarting your computer)
\item
  If you receive an error indicating that a function isn't working or recognized, and you have loaded the package, type the name of the package in front of the function with two colons (e.g., psych::describe(df). If multiple packages are loaded with functions that have the same name, R can get confused.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{strategies-for-success}{%
\subsection{stRategies for success}\label{strategies-for-success}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Engage with R, but don't let it overwhelm you.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The \emph{mechanical is also the conceptual}. Especially when it is \emph{simpler}, do try to retype the script into your own .rmd file and run it. Track down the errors you are making and fix them.
  \item
    If this stresses you out, move to simply copying the code into the .rmd file and running it. If you continue to have errors, you may have violated one of the best practices above (Is the package loaded? Are the data and .rmd files in the same place? Is all the prerequisite script run?).
  \item
    Still overwhelmed? Keep moving forward by downloading a copy of the .rmd file that accompanies any given chapter and just ``run it along'' with the lecture. Spend your mental power trying to understand what each piece does. Then select a practice problem that is appropriate for your next level of growth.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Copy script that works elsewhere and replace it with your datafile, variables, etc.\\
\item
  The leaRning curve is steep, but not impossible. Gladwell\citeyearpar{gladwell_outliers_2008} reminds us that it takes about 10,000 hours to get GREAT at something (2,000 to get reasonably competent). Practice. Practice. Practice.
\item
  Updates to R, R Studio, and the packages are NECESSARY, but can also be problematic. It could very well be that updates cause programs/script to fail (e.g., ``X has been deprecated for version X.XX''). Moreover, this very well could have happened between my distribution of these resources and your attempt to use it. My personal practice is to update R, R Studio, and the packages a week or two before each academic term.
\item
  Embrace your downward dog. Also, walk away, then come back.
\end{itemize}

I found this lesson to be more of a struggle to prepare than I expected. Why? There is a great deal of lore about what increases response rates and participation. Yet, research over the years had both supported and contradicted these claims. One example is where to include ``sensitive items.'' Historically, textbook authors have recommended that these should come last so that respondents would be engaged in the process and be more willing to complete the survey \citep{krathwohl_methods_2009, rowley_designing_2014}. Yet, research has shown that this has not held up in employee groups \citep{roberson_questionnaire_1990} nor among members of the National Association of Social Workers \citep{robert_g._green_should_2000}.

Given these contradictions, this lecture starts with the overall structure of a survey. The core of the lecture focuses on recent, evidence-based support for item-level decisions. I briefly discuss construct-specific guidance and discuss specific considerations for the on-line environment. I then close by addressing some of the decisions that I routinely make in survey construction and provide my rationale for why. Because this lesson occurs at the beginning of a text on psychometrics -- this ``skips over and around'' the issue of reliability and validity.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{components-of-the-questionnaire}{%
\section{Components of the Questionnaire}\label{components-of-the-questionnaire}}

Let's start by examining the components of a questionnaire and the general guidelines for their construction\citep{colton_designing_2015, pershing_ineffective_2001}:

\textbf{Title}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  reflect the content of the instrument
\item
  be concisely worded
\item
  be written in language easily understood by the respondents
\item
  should not be offensive or off-putting
\item
  should be formatted clearly at the top/beginning of the document
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Introductory Statement}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  include a brief summary of the instrument's purpose
\item
  contain an appropriate statement concerning the confidentiality of the respondent's information (informed consent)
\item
  be motivating such that respondents are inspired/willing to complete the items
\item
  specify the approximate amount of time required to complete the instrument
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Directions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  complete, unambiguous, concise
\item
  written at a language level appropriate to the respondents
\item
  tell the respondents how to return the instrument once they have completed it (surprisingly, in Qualtrics, this is also important; submission requires hitting that last little ``--\textgreater\textgreater{}'')
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Items} (discussed in a later section)

\textbf{Closing Statement}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  thank the participants for their participation
\item
  remind participants that their information is valuable and perhaps remind about

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    next steps or follow-up
  \item
    confidentiality
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Overall Structure/Look}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  should be coherent with an easy-to-follow layout
\item
  not crowded
\item
  professional appearance

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    not crowded, plenty of white space
  \item
    avoiding a ``slick look''
  \item
    numbering and headings to provide a sense of progress
  \item
    breaks between every 4-6 questions (or shading alternate items)
  \item
    in a sense, inviting and ``easy on the eye''
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Pershing and Pershing \citeyearpar{pershing_ineffective_2001} reviewed 50 \emph{reactionnaires} that were used by training evaluators at a ``prestigious medical school.'' Their purpose was to determine the degree to which the survey design adhered to the recommendations. The results suggested that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  72\% did not include an introductory statement; an additional 16\% were ``minimal''
\item
  78\% had no closing statement
\item
  30\% had no directions; another 54\% of directions were ``minimal''
\item
  8\% were professional in appearance
\end{itemize}

In summary, the formatting of the reactionnaires were not designed in a way that would maximize respondent engagement. In turn, we might expect this to threaten the psychometric reliability and validity.

\hypertarget{what-improves-or-threatens-response-rates-and-bias}{%
\section{What Improves (or Threatens) Response Rates and Bias?}\label{what-improves-or-threatens-response-rates-and-bias}}

It's not always clear, but well-designed studies and formal reviews of literature are revealing, sometimes surprising findings to old debates. When we design survey instruments based on our own preference rather than research-based evidence, we may get less than optimal data \citep{chyung_evidence-based_2018}.

Chyung et al.~(2018) reviewed the five steps \citep{schwarz_asking_2001} that survey respondents engage when answering structured, closed-ended survey items.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Interpreting the question
\item
  Retrieving information from their memory
\item
  Integrating the information
\item
  Selecting one of the given response options
\item
  Editing the answer for reasons of social desirability
\end{enumerate}

Chyung and colleagues appear to be starting such a systematic review. What follows are their evidence based evaluations regarding some of the most common questions about questionnaire construction.

\hypertarget{should-likert-type-scales-include-a-midpoint}{%
\subsection{Should Likert-type scales include a midpoint?}\label{should-likert-type-scales-include-a-midpoint}}

Chyung et al. \citeyearpar{chyung_evidence-based_2017} reviewed the literature on whether/not to use a \textbf{midpoint} (``neutral'' or ``neither disagree nor agree''). Examining their article, we can see variants of Likert-style scaling for a scale of agreement. They look something like this:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.19}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.19}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.09}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.27}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.09}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.17}}@{}}
\toprule
Type & & & & & \\
\midrule
\endhead
No midpoint (4 pt) & Strongly Disagree & Disagree & \emph{skipped} & Agree & Strongly Agree \\
Midpoint (5 pt) & Strongly Disagree & Disagree & Neither Disagree Nor Agree & Agree & Strongly Agree \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Chyung and colleagues quickly suggest that the question is not ``Should I use a midpoint?'' but rather ``When should I use a midpoint?''

The article is more detailed, but essentially, a midpoint is appropriate when:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the measurement scale is interval (instead of ordinal; this is a good statistical property to have)
\item
  the question content is such that the midpoint is a \emph{true} midpoint and not a point for hedging or avoiding
\end{itemize}

If a true midpoint is impossible, then consider adding an option such as ``I don't know'' or ``It depends.'' Of course these introduce scoring dilemmas (e.g., needing to be recoded as missing; then having a plan for managing missingness) that will need to be addressed in preparing the data for analysis.

\hypertarget{should-continuous-rating-scales-be-used-in-surveys}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Should \emph{continuous rating scales} be used in surveys?}{Should continuous rating scales be used in surveys?}}\label{should-continuous-rating-scales-be-used-in-surveys}}

First, let's consider the distinction between \emph{discrete}, \emph{continuous}, and \emph{numerical} scales. Figure 4 in the Chyung, Swanson, Roberts, and Hankinson \citeyearpar{chyung_evidencebased_2018-1} article illustrate the major differences and some variations.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Discrete} scales are Likert-type scales that range range between 2 and 11 \emph{discrete} options. Clasically, respondents pick \emph{words} (e.g., pain rated as \emph{no pain}, \emph{mild}, \emph{moderate}, \emph{severe}, \emph{extreme}, \emph{worst pain possible}).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    6-point discrete rating scales result in a collection of six \emph{ordered values}
  \item
    thus they are on the ordinal measurement scale and (as discussed above)
  \item
    they should be analyzed with non-parametric statistical procedures (parametric approaches can be used if the data are normally distributed and there is a mid-point)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Continuous} scales allow respondents to indicate a response anywhere within a given range -- usually by marking a place on a horizontal line on a continuum of a minimum of 100 points. There are no discrete categories defined by words or numbers. In Qualtrics there is a slider option.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Continuous scales result in precise numbers (e.g., 26 or 26.8 if the scale is 0 to 100)
  \item
    these are on an interval-level measurement scale AND
  \item
    they can be evaluated with parametric statistical analyses
  \item
    \emph{visual analog scales (VAS; aka graphic rating scales, GRS)} are another variant of continuous rating scales if they allow the participants to make ``anywhere on the line.'' Some VAS scales have verbal descriptors to guide the marking; some have numbers (hence, \emph{numerical response scales})
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Which is better? The mixed results are summarized in Chyung et al's \citeyearpar{chyung_evidencebased_2018-1} Table 1. With a focus on the types of research I encounter in my program, here is my take-away:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Continuous scales provide better data (more precise/full information, more likely to be normally distributed, better reliability) for statistical analysis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Caveat:} If the response scale on a Likert scale is increased to 11, there is a better chance to have normally distributed responses.
  \item
    \emph{Caveat:} When ``simple descriptives'' are desired (e.g., histograms, frequency distributions) the discrete scale may be the best choice.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Both are easy to use, except in the case where respondents complete the surveys on mobile devices.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Caveat:} there has been more missing data with sliders (compared to radio buttons)
  \item
    \emph{Caveat:} respondents are more likely to change their responses on sliders. If this means there is greater accuracy or more careful responding, this is desirable.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In both circumstances adding ``don't know,'' ``prefer not to respond,'' or ``not applicable'' may improve the validity of the responses
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{should-likert-type-response-options-use-an-ascending-or-descending-order}{%
\subsection{Should Likert-type response options use an ascending or descending order?}\label{should-likert-type-response-options-use-an-ascending-or-descending-order}}

Let's first look at the difference \citep{chyung_evidence-based_2018}:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.16}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.19}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.16}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.16}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.16}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 10\tabcolsep) * \real{0.17}}@{}}
\toprule
Type & & & & & \\
\midrule
\endhead
Ascending & Strongly Disagree & Disagree & Neither Disagree Nor Agree & Agree & Strongly Agree \\
Descending & Strongly Agree & Agree & Neither Agree Nor Disagree & Disagree & Strongly Disagree \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

In the consideration of the choice between ascending/descending, we are concerned with \emph{response-order effects}. Let's first examine these conceptually/theoretically.

\textbf{Recency effect} is the tendency of survey respondents to select the options that they see at the end of the response-option list. This is expected when options are presented orally (e.g., during interviews, people tend to choose from the last-offered options)

\textbf{Primacy effect} is the survey respondents' tendency to select the options that are presented at the beginning of the
response-option list. This is expected when options are presented visually. For example, people tend to choose among the first-presented categories in self-administered written survey questionnaires.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{left-sided selection bias} occurs when respondents read text from left-to-right and are more inclined to select options from the left.
\item
  \emph{satisficing theory} occurs when individuals seek solutions that are ``simply satisfactory'' so as to minimize psychological costs. Thus, respondents may

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    select the first option that seems ``reasonable enough'',
  \item
    select the ``I don't know'' response, or
  \item
    randomly select one of the options.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{acquiesence bias} is the tendency for respondents to agree with the statement provided---aka yea-saying bias (e.g., being polite).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Closely related is \emph{social-desirability bias,} the tendency for respondents to select among the options they think are more socially acceptable or desirable (instead of true responses).
  \item
    In surveys, this generally is selecting \emph{agree} or \emph{strongly agree}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Considering these response biases together, Chyung et al.~suggest that when the response options are presented in descending order (\emph{Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree}), respondents would (theoretically) see a positive option immediately on the left side of the response scale and perceive it to be socially desirable and satisfactory, resulting in their decision to select it without having to spend more time to choose a true response. However, the same effects may or may not happen when the response options are presented in ascending order (\emph{Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly agree}).

After reviewing 13 studies, Chyung et al.~observed that many studies (paper and web based, with children and adults, in English and other language):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  revealed response-order effects in self administered surveys, especially the primacy effect, associated with left-side selection bias, acquiescence bias, and satisficing.
\item
  showed more positive average scores from descending-ordered scales
\end{itemize}

Recommendations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  present response scales in ascending order

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    when a number line is used, lower and negative numbers should be on the left
  \end{itemize}
\item
  when using descended order scales

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    keep respondents motivated to complete items accurately
  \item
    present half items with descended-ordered scales and the other half with ascended-ordered scales
  \item
    assign half of participants with descended-ordered scales; half with ascended-ordered scales
  \item
    present response options vertically rather than horizontally
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{should-surveys-include-negatively-worded-items}{%
\subsection{Should surveys include negatively worded items?}\label{should-surveys-include-negatively-worded-items}}

In examining this question, Chyung et al. \citep{chyung_evidencebased_2018} made a distinction between (see Table 1 in the article):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Statement format} the same response scale such as a Likert scale
\item
  \textbf{Question format} different response scales that are tailored to individual survey questions. A challenge with this format is the difficulty in calculating an average score of data obtained from multiple survey items.
\end{itemize}

The advent of negatively-worded items began with Rensis Likert in 1932. He was an American social psychologist who, in attempt to mitigate aqcuiescence/yea-saying biases, recommended designing one half of survey items to be associated with agreement and the other half with disagreement. Although Likert recommended ``straightforward statements,'' incorporating negative words can become quickly complicated. Table 2 in the Chyung paper shows that there are four ways of wording survey statements:

\textbf{Reverse-coding}, which is necessary when including negatively worded items in a scale, assumes that agreeing to a positively worded statement and disagreeing to its negatively worded counterpart are the same. Tables 3 and 4 in the ms show how this assumption may be faulty.

A review of the negatively-worded-item literature suggested the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scales with all positively worded items yielded greater accuracy when compared with all negatively worded items or mixed worded items
\item
  scores on positively and negatively worded items are not the same (e.g., strongly disagreeing to a positively worded statement is differenf from strongly agreeing to a negatively worded statement)
\item
  positively worded items produce higher means than negatively worded items. This may be due to

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    carelessness and fatigue in reading items
  \item
    the cognitive processing of postive and negative items may be different
  \end{itemize}
\item
  a \emph{method factor} has shown itself where in factor analyses of scales with factor structures unrelated to the wording, exploratory approaches to factor analysis have produced separate factors with the negatively worded (or otherwise ambiguous) items, this results in a threat to construct validity and reliability.
\end{itemize}

Chyung, Barkin, and Ramsey \citeyearpar{chyung_evidencebased_2018} noted that resondent performance declines approximately 12 minutes after respondents start a survey. This relates to negatively worded items because it appeared that respondents increasingly failed to notice negatively worded statements even when there were efforts to draw their attention to them via bolding, underlining, or capitalizing the negated element (e.g., \emph{not}). Thus, when negatively worded items are used, they should probably be presented early in the protocol.

Chyung et al \citeyearpar{chyung_evidencebased_2018} also cautioned about a response set bias that can occur when using all positively worded items. They recommended making design choices that enhance bias-free and accurate responding based on the research design.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For example, attributes to be measured in some constructs (e.g., depression, anxiety) are, themselves, negative and so a negatively worded item may be most clear and appropriate.
\item
  The inclusion (and subsequent analysis) of negatively phrased items may help \emph{detect} acquiesence bias.
\item
  Table 5 in the manuscript provides some guidelines that are more nuanced when negative items must be included. For example,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ensure that negatively worded items are true polar opposites and symmetrical (so they can be analyzed with the positively worded items)
  \item
    group negative items together (and forewarn/format so they are recognized as such)
  \item
    administer the survey when respondents are not fatigued
  \item
    analyze the effect of the negatively worded items
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{construct-specific-guidance}{%
\section{Construct-specific guidance}\label{construct-specific-guidance}}

Self-efficacy is domain-specific construct. That is, even though there are some \emph{general self-efficacy scales} Bandura's original definition suggests that it should be task specific (i.e., career decision-making self-efficacy, math self-efficacy).

This construct is an example where Bandura, himself \citeyearpar{bandura_guide_2006}, provided specific guidelines for creating these task-specific assessments. Generally they included:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  phrasing items as ``can do'' rather than ``will do,''
\item
  maintaining consistency with the self-efficacy construct definition (e.g., domain specific, a focus on capability rather than self-worth),
\item
  including items that reflect gradations of challenge,
\item
  asking individuals to rate their current (as opposed to future) operative capabilities
\item
  scaling should be on a 100 point scale
\end{enumerate}

Nearly a decade ago, a survey of human subjects review boards suggested that 94\% of the IRB applications reviewed involved online or Web-based surveys \citep{buchanan_online_2009}. Thus, it is important to give some specifical conceptual consideration to the online environment.

A first set of considerations involve data security, identity, and permission (implicit and explicit).

The \textbf{IP address} as well as \textbf{longitude/latitude} has been a contentious issue for a number of years \citep{buchanan_online_2009}. EU data protection laws consider IP addresses as personally identifiable data; in the U.S., IP addresses typically fall outside the definition of ``personal information.'' In Qualtrics, the default is to collect and download the IP address (the ``anonymize response'' option can prevent this data from being collected). On the one hand it is helpful to know geographically ``from where'' participants are responding; on the other, some consider its capture to be a violation of privacy.

Relatedly, what is considered to be \textbf{fully informed consent} \citep{conrad_survey_2007}. Is it ethical to capture paradata (e.g., typing speed, changed answers, response times) or metadata without explicitly saying so?

\textbf{The tool} being used to collect the data is concerning. Buchanan and Hvizdak \citeyearpar{buchanan_online_2009} argued that until each tool is vetted and its privacy policies and data security policies are understood, we cannot be 100\% certain how security, consent, and privacy are instantiated within the individual tools. For example, it is possible that tool creators \emph{could} gather respondent data and repurpose it for their own marketing, for sale to other researchers, and so forth

Online and web-based protocols increase our reach geographically and cross-culturally. For now, I will bracket out the issue of cultural translation, for the purpose of online the question is about \textbf{access} \citep{conrad_survey_2007}. Think about the decades of psychological research based on White, college-educated, males. Are we creating another strata of privileged research with technology that may not be accessible in terms of both internet/technology as well as capacity/fluency with the tool? On the other hand, what are the risks of not adopting new technologies before everyone has them.

When paper/pencil measures were administered in face-to-face settings (individually or in auditoriums of students) there was some degree of \textbf{standardized protocol.} This is lost when surveys are administered online and we cannot guarantee \emph{who} is taking the survey. To what degree does this matter?

When respondents are remote, what happens if they have a \textbf{negative reaction to the survey}? In a face-to-face context, debriefings can occur and referrals can be made. How is this managed remotely?

\textbf{Security of test items} might also be concerning. It is not ok to use propietary items without the permission of the testmaker. If the security of items is important (e.g., SAT/GRE, intelligence test items, inkblots) because they are central to administration, how can this be protected in the virtual environment?

Consequently, when students in our programs write doctoral dissertations they are to narrate the following in their Method section.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe how informed consent will be obtained in the online environment.
\item
  Describe the level of identification that is collected. If the claim of ``anonymous'' or ``de-identified'' indicate whether/not this includes capturing the IP address; some researchers believe that capturing a computer's IP address threatens anonymity.
\item
  Describe the steps to be taken to ensure that respondents met the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study.
\item
  Anticipate and describe how the online (e.g., uncontrolled, public, distractions) setting might affect responses.
\item
  Particularly if the survey contained sensitive materials, describe how respondents might access resources for debriefing or referral.
\item
  Identify the permissions (from original authors or copyright holders) granted to reformat and post (on the internet) existing surveys. If items are considered to be secure (e.g., those on the MMPI or WAIS), identify steps taken to protect them.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{in-my-surveys}{%
\section{In my Surveys}\label{in-my-surveys}}

Because there isn't empirical data on every decision that we make in survey construction, I thought it might be useful for me to address some of the decisions that I find myself making in the online surveys I use in my own research.

\hypertarget{demographics-and-background-information}{%
\subsection{Demographics and Background Information}\label{demographics-and-background-information}}

A core value that I hope to reflect in the \emph{ReCentering Psych Stats} series is to promote socially and culturally responsive research. Correspondingly, the information we collect from participants should ensure that they feel that their identities are authentically reflected in the survey. Naively, when I first considered how to capture race/ethnicity in my surveys, I looked to the categories used in the U.S. Census. Immediately, I learned that this is problematic. Rather than elaborating here, I invite you to take a listen to NPR's \href{https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch}{Code Switch} podcast had a series of episodes that included a discussion of the evolution of the race and ethnicity question. Two of the episodes review how the race/ethnicity question is used and and why it is problematic: \href{https://www.npr.org/transcripts/607553683}{Census Watch 2020} and \href{https://www.npr.org/transcripts/540671012}{The U.S. Census and Our Sense of Us}. As made clear in the Code Switch podcasts, the race/ethnicity question in the U.S. Census \emph{erases} people when their identities are not included.

My last few surveys have captured race/ethnicity data differently. Each time, I engage in several practices that (I hope) will continue to shape the item in a socially and culturally responsive way. Systematically, I:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  conduct a quick internet search to see if there is an emerging best practice (even though I may have also searched weeks or months prior),
\item
  consider who the intended research population is in relationship to the topic of investigation,
\item
  look to recently published, similar, research to see what other researchers are doing, and
\item
  ask for a colleagial, formative review from individuals who hold marginalized identities, whose data will be requested in the survey.
\end{itemize}

When I engage in research, I try to balance the need to quantify (with discrete categories) who is participating in the survey and inviting respondents to state (in their own words) their identity. This is consistent with my view that variables like race, ethnicity, and gender identity as socially constructed. In addition to this particular worldview, Parent \citeyearpar{parent_handling_2013} has suggested that the worst possible kind of missing data pattern (MNAR -- missing not at random) may be caused when items are \emph{unanswerable} to particular person. Therefore, it is essential that all individuals find their place in the items that assess demographic variables.

My last survey was directed toward community members (including students, alumni, staff, faculty) of my predominantly White, liberal arts, Christian institution. After reviewing recently published research articles and consulting with a handful of individuals, I chose to include the following categories -- \emph{each with a text write-in box} so that individuals could select the category(ies) that fit best and have the opportunity to refine it(them). I am excited to review this data because such responses may inform my next survey. The categories included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Asian or Pacific Islander
\item
  Black or African American
\item
  Hispanic or Latino
\item
  Native American or Alaskan Native
\item
  White or Caucasian
\item
  Biracial or multiracial
\item
  An international/global identity that does not fit in the U.S. categorization of race/ethnicity
\item
  A race/ethnicity not listed above
\end{itemize}

Note that individuals could select multiplecategories

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/QuestCon/RaceEthnicity.jpg}
\caption{Image of a survey item inquiring about race/ethnicity from a survey. Each option has an option for the respondent to clarify.}
\end{figure}

The option to select multiple boxes will result in some extra coding when we prepare the data for analysis. I am taking approach that we will \emph{listen} to the data and decide, based on the results, how to report the findings in a way that will efficiently fit into an APA style empirical paper and honor the participants.

The population of interest for this particular study are those who are engaged in protest activities regarding hiring practices and policies that result in discrimination to members of the LGBTQIA+ community. This means that questions of gender identity, pronouns, and relationship to the LGBTQIA+ community are important to the research, but needed to be asked sensitively and with great security of the data.

Regarding gender identity, I used a similar approach to the race/ethnicity question, allowing individuals to select multiple categories and offering write-in boxes for each. The categories included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  female
\item
  male
\item
  nonbinary
\item
  transwoman
\item
  transman
\item
  something else
\item
  prefer not to say
\end{itemize}

Additionally, I invited individuals to identify their pronouns. Again, write-in boxes were offered with each option.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  they/them/theirs
\item
  she/her/hers
\item
  he/him/his
\item
  they/she/he
\item
  neo pronouns (e.g., xe/xem/xyr, ze/hir/hirs, ey/em/eir)
\item
  something else
\end{itemize}

Finally, we wanted individuals to indicate their relationship to the LGBTQIA+ community. We asked them to select all that apply. Only the ``something else'' box had a write-in option:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Member
\item
  Exploring/Questioning
\item
  Ally
\item
  Not related
\item
  Something else (with a write-in box)
\end{itemize}

I expect that my future surveys may inquire about these variables differently. If you have found a different way to ask, please fconsider e-mailing me. I would love to provide different options and give credit to contributors.

\hypertarget{survey-order}{%
\subsection{Survey Order}\label{survey-order}}

Historically, demographic information has been first or last in the survey. Although some research has reported no differences in response rates when demographic and sensitive data are at the beginning or end \citep{krathwohl_methods_2009, rowley_designing_2014}, I am inclined to open the survey with questionnaire items that are closely related to the topic listed on the recruitment materials and end the survey with the demographic information. Why? It makes sense to me that if someone has responded positively to the survey topic, they expect to answer questions (right away) about that topic.

In between that opening survey and closing demographic items, I consider if there are any \emph{order effects} that would engage in undue \emph{priming} of responses. If there are such concerns, I think through the order to minimize them. If there are no such concerns, I put my surveys in blocks and then ask my survey program to randomly present the blocks. This serves two purposes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  counterbalancing possible order effects, and
\item
  distributing missingness for individuals who do not complete the survey.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{forced-responses}{%
\subsection{Forced Responses}\label{forced-responses}}

Programs like Qualtrics are able to engage in a variety of \emph{content validation} procedures. If these are in place, they may require the person to enter a properly formatted response (e.g., phone number, e-mail address, numerical response between 0 and 100) before responding. These are extremely helpful tools in collecting data that will be closest-to-being-ready-for-analysis. These same procedures can \emph{force} or \emph{request} a response.

\emph{Requiring} a response is tempting. However, doing so violate IRB requirements that allow a person to skip or ``quit at any time without penalty.'' They may also anger a person such that they stop responding. Some researchers get around this by \emph{requiring} the response, but including a ``Not applicable'' or ``Prefer to not answer'' column. Because I worry that (a) the respondent may confuse that option with one extreme of the scale and/or (b) my research team and I will forget to code it as missing data, I prefer the \emph{request} response alternative.

In Qualtrics in particular, I turn on the ``Request response'' feature for each of the questions. If an item is skipped, a simple warning is displayed that invites the respondent to review the page of answers to see if they would like to answer the question. If not, they can simply move forward.

\hypertarget{research-vignette}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette}}

I will demonstrate the qual``TRIX'' by using a Qualtrics account at my institution, Seattle Pacific University. The only surveys in this account are for the \emph{Recentering Psych Stats} chapters and lessons. All surveys are designed to not capture personally identifying information and not collecting IP addresses nor longitude/latitude. I use this survey in several lessons in this OER. If you haven't taken the survey yet, \href{https://spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU}{I invite you to do so, now}.

As a teaching activity for the ReCentering Psych Stats OER, the topic of the survey was selected to be consistent with the overall theme of OER. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to understand the campus climate for students whose identities make them vulnerable to bias and discrimination. These include students who are Black, non-Black students of color, LGBTQ+ students, international students, and students with disabilities.

After consulting with a diverse group of stakeholders and subject matter experts (and revising the response options numerous times) I have attempted to center anti-Black racism in the U.S. \citep{mosley_critical_2021, mosley_radical_2020, singh_building_2020}. In fact, the display logic does not present the race items when the course is offered outside the U.S. There are only five options for race: \emph{biracial/multiracial}, \emph{Black}, \emph{non-Black person(s) of color}, \emph{White}, and \emph{I did not notice} (intended to capture a color-blind response). One unintended negative consequence of this design is that the response options could contribute to \emph{colorism} \citep{adames_fallacy_2021, capielo_rosario_acculturation_2019}. Another possibility is that the limited options may erase, or make invisible, other identities. At the time that I wrote up the first description of this survey, the murder of six Asian American women in Atlanta had just occurred. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremeism has documented that while overall hate drimes dropped by 7\% in 2020, anti-Asian hate crimes reported to the police in America's largest cities increased by 149\% \citep{noauthor_fact_nodate}. These incidents have occurred not only in cities, but in our neighborhoods and on our campusus \citep{kim_guest_2021, kim_yes_2021, noauthor_stop_nodate}. While this survey is intended to assess campus climate as a function of race, it unfortunately does not distinguish between many identities that experience marginalization.

Although the dataset should provide the opportunity to test a number of statistical models, one working hypothesis that framed the study is that the there will be a greater sense of belonging and less bias and discrimination when there is similar representation (of identities that are often marginalized) in the instructional faculty and student body. Termed, ``structural diversity'' \citep{lewis_black_2019} this is likely an oversimplification. In fact, an increase in diverse representation without attention to interacting factors can increase hostility on campus \citep{hurtado_linking_2007}. Thus, the task of rating of a single course relates to the larger campus along the dimensions of belonging and bias/discrimination. For example, if a single class has higher ratings on issues of inclusivity, diversity, and respect, we would expect that sentiment to be echoed in the broader institution.

The survey design has notable limitations You will likely notice that we ask about demographic characteristics of the instructional staff and classmates in the course rated, but we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent. In making this decision, we likely lose important information. For example, Iacovino and James \citeyearpar{iacovino_retaining_2016} have noted that White students perceive campus more favorably than Black student counterparts.

The decision to not collect demographic details about the respondent was about protecting their (your) identity. As you will see, you have the opportunity to download and analyze the data. If a faculty member asked an entire class to take the survey, the datestamp and a handful of demographic identifiers could very likely identify a student. In certain circumstances, this might be risky in that private information (i.e., gender nonconformity, disclosure of a disability) along with course evaluation data and a datestamp could be related back to the student.

Further, the items that ask respondents to \emph{guess} the identities of the instructional staff and classmates are limited, and contrary to best practices in survey construction that recommend providing the option of a ``write-in'' a response.

In parallel, the items asking respondents to identity characteristics of the instructional staff along dimensions of gender, international status, and disability are ``large buckets'' and do not include ``write-in'' options. Similarly, there was no intent to cause harm by erasing or making invisible individuals whose identities are better defined by different descriptors. Further, no write-in items were allowed. This was also intentional to prevent potential harm caused by people who could leave inappropriate, racist, or otherwise harmful comments.

As I review Qualtrics essentials and trix, I will their use (if used) in the ReCentering Psych Stats survey.

\hypertarget{qualtrics-essentials}{%
\section{Qualtrics Essentials}\label{qualtrics-essentials}}

Qualtrics is a powerful program and I find that many of the surveys we distribute don't capitalize on the features Qualtrics has to offer. Qualtrics has detailed tutorials and instructions that are well worth the investment of a weekend to review them.

In this lecture I will point you to the elements that I think are critical to constructing online surveys. Because Qualtrics tutorials are (a) clear and thorough and (b) frequently updated, I will (a) point you to the tutorials that are available at the time of this lecture prep, (b) tell you why I think they are appropriate, and (c) show you how we have used them in some of our own surveys.

Even if you think you know what you are doing, start here (and then always take the time to ``look around'' at all the options on each window):

\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/block-options/block-options-overview/}{\textbf{Blocks}} are the basic organizational tool in Qualtrics surveys. Blocks have two purposes: (a) grouping items shown on ``one page,'' and (b) using the block for easy ordering and/or random selection/presentation.

\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/question-types-overview/}{\textbf{Question types}}: Take a time to look at ALL the options. You might be surprised to learn that there is a better choice than you might have imagined.

Let's take a look at super basic/helpful question types:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/static-content/descriptive-text-and-graphic/}{\textbf{Text/graphic}}: These are the types you should use for providing information (e.g., informed consent) to the participants.\\
\item
  \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/standard-content/matrix-table/}{\textbf{Matrix table}} : A more efficient way to use the Likert-style items (than multiple choice). There is some controversy about whether not to use matrix tables vs.~multiple choice dropdowns\ldots{}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Make sure to select a reasonable amount of header repetition. This allows the respondent the maximum opportunity to see the column descriptors while they are responding.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/standard-content/slider/}{\textbf{Slider}} : This gets you continuous data on that 1 to 100 scale. If the scale you are using is already published, and has not been psychometrically evaluated for slider use, you should probably stick with the format recommended in the publication. But if YOU are designing a survey, think about this option.
\item
  \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/standard-content/text-entry/}{\textbf{Text Entry Questions}} have multiple options for length of answer. Don't miss the options that include forms and content validation\\
\item
  \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/validation/}{\textbf{Validation}}: Allows the user to allow certain types of information and specify their formats (e.g., numbers, e-mail addresses, dates). There is a balancing between being overly restricting and ensuring that the data is entered in the most clear and consistent way possible. A validation option I frequently use is one that asks individuals if they intended to leave something blank. This is tool that helps prevent missingness without forcing an individual to respond to an item that (a) might not be clear to them, (b) might not be appropriate or them, and/or (c) might result in an answer that is untrue for their unique circumstance.
\end{itemize}

The ability to \textbf{schedule survey distributions} is like having your very own GA! If you have a roster(contact list) you can schedule distributions, reminders, and thank yous. Qualtrics will keep track of who responds and send reminders to the non-responders. Here are resources for

\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-flow/standard-elements/randomizer/}{\textbf{Randomization} of blocks} (or a subset of blocks) can be use for several purposes such as: (a) using random selection to display one or more blocks to respondents -- as in a random clinical trial, (b) to randomly display a percentage of blocks or items to shorten the survey in a planned missing design, and (c) randomly display some or all of the blocks of the survey to all respondents so that when respondents experience test fatigue, when they quit responding, ``the last items/surveys'' aren't always the same ones -- thus distributing the missingness across surveys.

\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/block-options/question-randomization/}{\textbf{Randomization} of items} within a block can be used for similar purposes. You can also use this to display only some of the items (e.g., planned missingness).

\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/advanced/file-upload/}{\textbf{File upload} from respondents} is an additional package that requires the institution to pay a higher fee. If available, this allows respondents to upload some sort of file (photo, powerpoint, .pdf). We use it for poster contests at professional contests (where students upload their poster for online judging in advance of the conference). A colleague of mine uses this function to collect application elements (i.e., resumes, cover letters, reference letters) to a fellowship program.

  As researchers, we can also upload files (e.g., hardcopy of informed consent, documents to be reviewed) for use by the respondent.

\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/question-options/display-logic/}{\textbf{Display, Skip, and/or Branch Logic}} can be used to help display to respondents \emph{only} the items that pertain to them. There are multiple approaches to doing this. Using a display logic approach may feel a bit \emph{backward} where the logic is applied \emph{from} the landing spot. We did this extensively in as study that involved two language versions and three age options.

Two other approaches for these issues are \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/question-options/skip-logic/}{skip logic} and \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-flow/standard-elements/branch-logic/}{branch logic}

We can use Qualtrics tools for purposes beyond collecting and downloading data. These tools are especially useful when I think about IRB applications and ethics related to data collection.

\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/}{\textbf{Exporting to Word}} Helpful for your IRB application (and perhaps in a cloud so that a team can use track changes to edit), it is super simple to export the survey to Microsoft Word. PLUS! You have options for including question numbers, recode values, logic, etc., so that it is essentially a codebook.

\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/distributions-module/web-distribution/anonymous-link/}{\textbf{Anonymizing responses}} Another step toward an anonymous response is to withhold the IP address. This is accomplished in the Survey Options menu.

\section{intRavenous Qualtrics}\label{intravenous-qualtrics}}

Access credentials for the institutional account, individual user's account, and survey are essential for getting the survey items and/or results to export into R. The Qualtrics website provides a tutorial for \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/integrations/api-integration/overview/\#GeneratingAnAPIToken}{generating an API token}.

We need two pieces of information: the \textbf{root\_url} and an \textbf{API token}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Log into your respective qualtrics.com account.
\item
  Select Account Settings
\item
  Choose ``Qualtrics IDs'' from the user name dropdown
\end{itemize}

We need the \textbf{root\_url}. This is the first part of the web address for the Qualtrics account. For our institution it is: spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com

The API token is in the box labeled, ``API.'' If it is empty, select, ``Generate Token.'' If you do not have this option, locate the \emph{brand administrator} for your Qualtrics account. They will need to set up your account so that you have API privileges.

\emph{BE CAREFUL WITH THE API TOKEN} This is the key to your Qualtrics accounts. If you leave it in an .rmd file that you forward to someone else, this key and the base URL gives access to every survey in your account. If you share it, you could be releasing survey data to others that would violate confidentiality promises in an IRB application.

If you mistakenly give out your API token you can generate a new one within your Qualtrics account and re-protect all its contents.

You do need to change the API key/token if you want to download data from a different Qualtrics account. If your list of surveys generates the wrong set of surveys, restart R, make sure you have the correct API token and try again.

\hypertarget{the-codebook}{%
\subsection{The Codebook}\label{the-codebook}}

In order to prepare data from a survey, it is critical to know about its content, scoring directions for scales/subscales, and its design. As I demonstrated above, we can export a \href{./Rate-a-Course_Codebook.pdf}{codebook}, that is, a Word (or PDF) version of the survey with all the coding. In Qualtrics the protocol is: Survey/Tools/ImportExport/Export Survey to Word. Then select all the options you want (especially ``Show Coded Values''). A tutorial provided by Qualtrics can be found \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/}{here}. This same process can be used to print the PDF example I used above.

I recommend providing custom variable names and recode values directly in Qualtrics before exporting them into R. A Qualtrics tutorial for this is provided \href{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/question-options/recode-values/}{here}. In general, consider these qualities when creating variable names:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Brevity: historically, SPSS variable names could be a maximum of 8 characters.
\item
  Intuitive: although variables can be renamed in R (e.g., for use in charts and tables), it is helpful when the name imported from Qualtrics provides some indication of what the variable is.
\item
  Systematic: start items in a scale with the same stem, followed by the item number -- ITEM1, ITEM2, ITEM3.
\end{itemize}

More complete information about data preparation is covered in chapters in the \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/ReC_MultivariateModeling/}{ReCentering Psych Stats: Multivariate Modeling} text.

\hypertarget{using-data-from-an-exported-qualtrics-.csv-file}{%
\subsection{Using data from an exported Qualtrics .csv file}\label{using-data-from-an-exported-qualtrics-.csv-file}}

The lecture focused on the ``intRavenous'' import. It is is also possible to download the Qualtrics data in a variety of formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, SPSS). Since I got started using files with the CSV extension (think ``Excel'' lite), that is my preference.

In Qualtrics, these are the steps to download the data: Projects/YOURsurvey/Data \& Analysis/Export \& Import/Export data/CSV/Use numeric values

I think that it is critical that to save this file in the same folder as the .rmd file that you will use with the data.

R is sensitive to characters used filenames As downloaded, my Qualtrics .csv file had a long name with spaces and symbols that are not allowed. Therore, I gave it a simple, sensible, filename, ``ReC\_Download210319.csv''. An idiosyncracy of mine is to datestamp filenames. I use two-digit representations of the year, month, and date so that if the letters preceding the date are the same, the files would alphabetize automatically.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\#library(qualtRics)}
\CommentTok{\#QTRX\_csv \textless{}{-} read\_survey("ReC\_Download210319.csv", strip\_html = TRUE, import\_id = FALSE, time\_zone=NULL, legacy = FALSE)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Although minor tweaking may be required, the same script above should be applicable to this version of the data.

\hypertarget{tweaking-data-format}{%
\subsection{Tweaking Data Format}\label{tweaking-data-format}}

Two general approaches:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Inside Qualtrics: Use the recode values option (found in the item's gearbox, to the left of the block) to specify variable names and recode values. These should be preserved on the download. \url{https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/question-options/recode-values/}
\item
  In the R script: In another lecture I demonstrate how to change the formats of data (character, string), selecting only the variables in which we are interested (e.g., excluding the meta-data), and renaming variables sensibly.
\end{enumerate}

Both work! Just a preference -- and probably have an explicit process approach within your research team/collaborators.

\hypertarget{practice-problems-1}{%
\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-1}}

The suggestion for practice is to develop a questionnaire, format it, pilot it, and download it. Essentially you will be

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Formatting a survey on Qualtrics using all the best practices identified in the lecture

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    these include having an introductory statement (to include statement of confidentiality), directions for each sub-survey (if more than one), and closing statement.
  \item
    selecting the most appropriate question type for the items. For example, matrix instead of multiple choice.
  \item
    within question type, using the appropriate options for proper formatting (e.g., the anchors in a matrix should be topically consistent and equal-interval)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The survey should include minimum of 3 of the qualTRIXter skills (identified in lecture); choose from

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    establishing collaboration
  \item
    scheduling e-mail distribution and follow-up
  \item
    personalizing the survey in some way
  \item
    randomization of blocks or items
  \item
    integrating display, skip, or branch logic (e.g., having males and females take a different route)
  \item
    exporting the survey to Word
  \item
    recoding variables in the item controls
  \item
    anonymize the responses
  \item
    prevent ballot box stuffing
  \item
    include a progress bar
  \item
    create a custom ending, e-mail, or thank-you note
  \item
    something else that YOU discovered that isn't in the lecture
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Piloting it, getting their feedback, and identifying what problems are (and how you might fix them)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    with 3 folks from your RVT, cohort, or this class
  \item
    with 3 additional folks who aren't quite as ``research savvy''
  \item
    collect their feedback (ideally in a text-item directly on the survey itself) and write a brief summary (3 paragraphs max) of their impressions and how you might improve the survey
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Import the Qualtrics data directly R

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    preferably, directly from Qualtrics with the API token, base URL, and survey ID
  \item
    alternatively (for the same \# of points) from the exported CSV file \emph{via the qualtRics package} (required)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The focus of this lecture is to provide an introduction to validity. This includes understanding some of the concerns of validity, different aspects of validity, and factors as they affect validity coefficients.

\hypertarget{navigating-this-lesson-2}{%
\section{Navigating this Lesson}\label{navigating-this-lesson-2}}

There is AMOUNT OF TIME of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional MORE TIME.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the \href{https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_Psychometrics}{Github site} that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER's \protect\hyperlink{ReCintro}{introduction}

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-2}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-2}}

Focusing on this week's materials, make sure you can:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Distinguish between different types of validity based on short descriptions.
\item
  Compute and interpret validity coefficients.
\item
  Evaluate the incremental validity of an instrument-of-interest.
\item
  Define and interpret the standard error of estimate.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{planning-for-practice-2}{%
\subsection{Planning for Practice}\label{planning-for-practice-2}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. With each of these options I encourage you to interpret examine aspects of the construct validity through the creation and interpretation of validity coefficients. Ideally, you will examine both convergent/discriminant or criterion validity as well as incremental validity.

\hypertarget{readings-resources-2}{%
\subsection{Readings \& Resources}\label{readings-resources-2}}

In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s). Other resources are cited (when possible, linked) in the text with complete citations in the reference list.

  \item
    In this manuscript, Clark and Watson (1995) create a beautiful blend of theoretical issues and practical suggestions for creating measures that evidence construct validity. From the practical perspective, the authors first guide potential scale constructors through the literature review and creating an item pool (including tips on writing items). The authors address structural validity by first beginning with strategies for constructing the test. In this section, the authors revisit the issue of dimensionality (i.e., alpha vs.~factor analysis). Finally, the authors look at initial data collection (addressing sample size) and psychometric evaluation.

\hypertarget{research-vignette-1}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-1}}

Explorations of validity often involve correlational in nature. This lesson provides descriptions of numerous aspects of establishing validity. Across several lessons, we will rework several several of the analyses. For this lesson in particular, the research vignette allows both convergent/discriminant validity as well as incremental validity.

The research vignette for this lesson is the development and psychometric evaluation of the Perceptions of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale \citeyearpar{szymanski_perceptions_2020}. The scale is six items with responses rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\emph{strongly disagree}) to 7 (\emph{strongly agree}). Higher scores indicate more negative perceptions of the LGBTQ campus climate Szymanski and Bissonette have suggested that the psychometric evaluation supports using the scale in its entirety or as subscales composed of the following items:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  College response to LGBTQ students:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    My university/college is cold and uncaring toward LGBTQ students. (cold)
  \item
    My university/college is unresponsive to the needs of LGBTQ students. (unresponsive)
  \item
    My university/colleg provides a supportive environment for LGBTQ students. {[}un{]}supportive; must be reverse-scored
  \end{itemize}
\item
  LGBTQ Stigma:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Negative attitudes toward LGBTQ persons are openly expressed on my university/college campus. (negative)
  \item
    Heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and cissexism are visible on my university/college campus. (heterosexism)
  \item
    LGBTQ students are harassed on my university/college campus. (harassed)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332062781_Perceptions_of_the_LGBTQ_College_Campus_Climate_Scale_Development_and_Psychometric_Evaluation/link/5ca0bef945851506d7377da7/download}{preprint} of the article is available at ResearchGate

In the \protect\hyperlink{rxx}{lesson} on reliability, I simulate item-level data. However, this lesson we will be interested in the correlations between the total and subscale scores with four additional scales:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  LGBTQ victimization
\item
  Satisfaction with college
\item
  Intention to pesist in college
\item
  Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms
\item
  Symptoms of depression

\section{Fundamentals of Validity}\label{fundamentals-of-validity}}

\textbf{Validity} (the classic definition) is the ability of a test to measure what it purports to measure. Supporting that definition are these notions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Validity is extent of matching, congruence, or ``goodness of fit'' between the operational definition and concept it is supposed to measure.
\item
  An instrument is said to be valid if it taps the concept it claims to measure.
\item
  Validity is the appropriateness of the interpretation of the results of an assessment procedure for a given group of individuals, not to the procedure itself.
\item
  Validity is a matter of degree; it does not exist on an all-or-none basis.
\item
  Validity is always specific to some particular use or interpretation.
\item
  Validity is a unitary concept.
\item
  Validity is involves an overall evaluative judgment.
\end{itemize}

Over the years (and, perhaps within each construct), validity has somewhat of an \emph{evolutionary} path from a focus on content, to prediction, to theory and hypothesis testing.

When the focus is on \textbf{content}, we are concerned with the:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  assessment of what individuals had learned in specific content areas
\item
  relevance of its content (i.e., we compare the content to the content domain)
\end{itemize}

When the focus is on \textbf{prediction}, we are concerned with:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  how different persons respond in a given situation (now or later).
\item
  the correlation coefficient between test scores (predictor) and the assessment of a criterion (performance in a situation)
\end{itemize}

A focus on \textbf{theory and hypothesis testing} adds:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a strengthened theoretical orientation
\item
  a close linkage between psychological theory and verification through empirical and experimental hypothesis testing
\item
  an emphasis on constructs in describing and understanding human behavior.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Constructs} are broad categories, derived from the common features shared by directly observable behavioral variables. They are theoretical entities and not directly observable. \textbf{Construct validity} is at the heart of psychometric evaluation. We define \textbf{construct validity} as the fundamental and all-inclusive validity concept, insofar as it specifies what the test measures. Content and predictive validation procedures are among the many sources of information that contribute to the understanding of the constructs assessed by a test.

\hypertarget{validity-criteria}{%
\section{Validity Criteria}\label{validity-criteria}}

We have just stated that validity is an overall, evaluative judgment. Within that umbrella are different criteria by which we judge the validity of a measure. We casually refer to them as \emph{types}, but each speaks to that unitary concept.

\hypertarget{content-validty}{%
\subsection{Content Validty}\label{content-validty}}

Content validity is concerned with the representativeness of the domain being assessed. Content validation procedures may differ depending on whether the test is in the educational/achievement context or if it is more of an attitude/behavioral survey.

In the educational/achievement context, content validation seeks to ensure the items on an exam are appropriate for the content domain being assessed.

A \textbf{table of specifications} is a two-way chart which indicates the instructionally relevant learning tasks to be measured. Percentages in the table indicate the relative degree of emphasis that each content area

Subject matter experts (SMEs)s are individuals chosen to evaluate items based on their degree of knowledge of the subject being assessed. If used:
-- report how many and professional qualifications
-- to classify items, report the directions they were given and the extent of agreement among judges.

Empirical procedures for enhancing content validity of educational assessments may include

-- comparing item-level and total scores with grades; lower grades should get lower scores.
-- analyzing individual errors;
- observing student work methods (have the students ``think aloud'' in front of an examiner).
-- evaluating the role of speed, noting how many do not complete the test in the time allowed.
-- correlating the scores with a reading comprehension test (if the exam is highly correlated, then it may be a test of reading and not another subject). Alternatively, if it is a reading comprehension test; give the student the questions (without the passage) to see how well they answered the questions on the basis of prior knowledge.

For surveys and tests outside of educational settings, content validation procedures ask, ``Does the test cover a representative sample of the specified skills and knowledge?'' and "Is test performance reasonably free from the influence of irrelevant variables? Naturally, SMEs might be used.

An example of content validation from Industrial-Organizational Psychology is the job analysis which precedes the development of test for employee selection and classification.
Not all tests require content analysis. In aptitude and personality tests we are probably more interested in other types of validity evaluation.

\hypertarget{face-validity-the-unvalidity}{%
\subsection{Face Validity: The ``un''validity}\label{face-validity-the-unvalidity}}

Face validity is concerned with the question, ``How does an assessment look on the `face of it'?'' Let's imagine that on a qualification exam for electricians, a math items asks the electrician to estimate the amount of yarn needed to complete a project. The item may be more \emph{face valid} if the calculation was with wire. Thus, face validity can often be improved by reformulating test items in terms that appear relevant and plausible for the context.

Face validity should never be regarded as a substitute for objectively determined validity. In contrast, it should not be assumed that when a (valid and reliable) test has been modified to increase its face validity, that its objective validity and reliability is unaltered. That is, it must be reevaluated.

\hypertarget{criterion-related-validity}{%
\subsection{Criterion Related Validity}\label{criterion-related-validity}}

Criterion related validity has to do with the test's ability to \emph{predict} an outcome (the criterion). If the criterion is something that occurs simultaneously, it is an assessment of \textbf{concurrent validity}; if it is in the future then it is an assessment of \textbf{predictive validity.}

A \textbf{criterion} is ``the thing'' that the test should, theoretically, be able to \emph{predict}. That prediction could be occurring at the same time (\emph{concurrent validity}) or at a future time (\emph{predictive validity}). Regardless, the estimate of the criteria must be independent of the survey/assessment being evaluated. The table below provides examples of types of tests and concurrent and predictive validity criteria.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 4\tabcolsep) * \real{0.35}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 4\tabcolsep) * \real{0.32}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 4\tabcolsep) * \real{0.32}}@{}}
\toprule
Type of Test & Concurrent Criteria Example & Predictive Criteria Example \\
\midrule
\endhead
A shorter (or cheaper) standardized achievement test & school grades, existing standardized tests & subsequent graduation/college admissions, cumulative GPA \\
Employee selection tests & decision made by a search committee & subsequent retention or promotion of the selected employee \\
Assessment of depression severity (shorter or cheaper) & diagnosis from a mental health professional; correlation with an established measure & inpatient hospitalization or act of self-harm \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{Contrasted groups} is a specific type of criterion-related validity. Clearly differentiated groups (e.g., sales clerks versus excutives; engineers versus musicians) are chosen to see if exam performance or profiles differ in predictable ways.

\textbf{Criterion contamination} occurs when test scores, themselves, are used to make decisions about the criteria. To prevent this,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No person who participates in the assignment of criterion ratings can have any knowledge of the examinee's test scores.\\
\item
  the test scores must be kept strictly confidentially.
\end{itemize}

There are a number of issues related to criterion-related validity.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is the criterion choice appropriate?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Criterion validity is only as good as the validity of the criterion towhich one is making a comparison.
    -- In the 1980s and 1990s there was more attention in this area. That is critics questioned the quality of the criterion being used.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  To what degree can the results of criterion-related validity be generalized? n
  -- Most tests are developed (intentionally) for a local context, setting, or audience. Consequently, in the local context, the criterion-prediction sample is usually too small (i.e., 50 cases or less).
  -- Those who want to generalize the test to a broader population should evaluate the test in relationship to the new purpose.
\item
  Is there a role for meta-analysis?
  -- Repeated validation studies of our tests, on different samples, results in a number of small-scale studies, each with their own validity coefficients.
  -- We can use meta-analytic procedures in reporting the results of validity coefficients when they are used for establishing criterion validity.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{construct-validity}{%
\subsection{Construct Validity}\label{construct-validity}}

\textbf{Construct validity} was introduced in 1954 in the irst edition of APA's testing standards and is defined as the extent to which the test may be said to measure a theoretical construct or trait. The overarching focus is on the role of \emph{psychological theory} in test construction and the ability to formulate hypotheses that can supported (or not) in the evaluation process. Construct validity is established by the accumulation of information from a variety of sources.

There are a number of sources that can be used to support construct validity.

\hypertarget{internal-consistency}{%
\subsection{Internal Consistency}\label{internal-consistency}}

In the next \protect\hyperlink{rxx}{chapter}, you will learn that \textbf{internal consistency} is generally considered to be an index of reliability. In the context of criterion-related validity, a goal is to ensure that the criterion is the total score on the test, itself. To that end, some of the following could also support this aspect of validity:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Compare high \& low scorers. Items that fail to show a significantly greater proportion of ``passes'' in the upper than the lower group are considered invalid, and are modified or eliminated.
\item
  Compute a biserial correlation between the item and total score.\\
\item
  Correlate the subtest score with the total score. Any subtest whose correlation with the total score is too low, is eliminated.
\item
  Although some take issue with this notion, the degree of \emph{homogeneity} (the degree to which items assess the same thing) has some bearing on construct validity. There is a tradeoff between items that measure a narrow slice of the construct definition (internal consistency estimates are likely to be higher) and those that sample the construct definition more broadly (internal consistency estimates are likely to be lower).
\end{itemize}

Admittedly, the contribution of internal consistency data is limited. In absence of external data, it tells us little about WHAT the test measures.

\hypertarget{exploratory-factor-analysis}{%
\subsection{Exploratory Factor Analysis}\label{exploratory-factor-analysis}}

\textbf{Exploratory factor analysis} (EFA) is used to simplify the description of behavior by reducing the number of categories (factors or dimensions) to as many as the numbers of the items to fewer. In instrument development, techniques like \emph{principal components analysis} or \emph{principal components analysis} are used to identify clusters (latent factors) among items. We frequently treat these as scales and subscales.

Imagine the use of 20 tests to 300 people. There would be 190 correlations.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Irrespective of content, we can probably summarize the intercorrelations of tests with 5-6 factors.
\item
  When the clustering of tests includes vocabulary, analogies, opposites, and sentence completions, we might suggest a ``verbal comprehension factor.''
\item
  Factorial validity is the correlation of the test with whatever is common to a group of tests or other indices of behavior. If our single test has a correlation of .66 with the factor on which it loads, then the ``factorial validity of the new test as a measure of the common trait is .66.''
\end{itemize}

When EFA is utilized the items are ``fed'' into an iterative process that analyzes the relations and ``reveals'' (or suggests -- we are the ones who interpret the data) how many factors (think scales/subscales) andwhich items comprise them.

\hypertarget{confirmatory-factor-analysis}{%
\subsection{Confirmatory Factor Analysis}\label{confirmatory-factor-analysis}}

\textbf{Confirmatory factor analysis} (CFA) involves specifying, a priori, a proposed relationship of items, scales, and subscales and then testing its \emph{goodness of fit.} In CFA (a form of structural equation modeling {[}SEM{]}), the latent variables (usually the higher order scales and total scale score) are positioned to cause the responses on the indicators/items.

Subsequent lessons provide examples of both EFA and CFA approaches to psychometrics.

\hypertarget{experimental-interventions}{%
\subsection{Experimental Interventions}\label{experimental-interventions}}

Construct validity is also supported by hypothesis testing and experimentation. If we expect that the construct assessed by the instrument is malleable (e.g., depression) and that an intervention could change it, then a treatment intervention or depression that reduced depression scores would simultaneously provide support for the intervention as well as the instrument.

\hypertarget{convergent-and-discriminant-validity}{%
\subsection{Convergent and Discriminant Validity}\label{convergent-and-discriminant-validity}}

In a psychometric evaluation, we will often administer our instrument-of-interest along with a battery of instruments that are more-and-less related. \textbf{Convergent validity} is supported when there are \emph{moderately high} correlations between our tests and the instruments with which we expect moderately high correlations. In contrast, \textbf{discriminant validity} is established by low and/or non-significant correlations between our instrument-of-interest and instruments that should be unrelated. For example, we want a low and non-significant correlation between a quantitative reasoning test and scores on a reading comprehension test. Why? Because if the correlation is too high, the test cannot discriminate between reading comprehension and math.

There are no strict cut-offs to establish convergence or discrimination. We can even ask, ``Could a correlation intended to support convergence be too high?'' It is possible! Unless the instrument-of-interest offers advantages such as brevity or cost, then correlations that fall into the ranges of multicollinearity or singularity can indicate unnecessary duplication or redundancy.

In our research vignette, Szymanski and Bissonette \citeyearpar{szymanski_perceptions_2020} conduct a correlation matrix that reports the bivariate relations between the LGBTQ Campus Climate full-scale as well as the College Response and Stigma subscales with measures that assess (a) LGBTQ victimization, (b) satisfaction with college, (c) persistence attitudes, and (d) anxiety, and (e) depression.

\end{verbatim}

Examination of these values (which align well with the results in the table) follow the expected pattern. That is, higher scores on the overall Campus Climate, College Response, and Stigma scales result in higher levels of victimization, anxiety and depression. Conversely, they are associated with lower college satisfaction and persistence.

The College Response and Stigma subscales' relations with satisfaction with college (-.59, -.41, respectively) and persistence attitudes (-.29*, -.19, respectively) are examples of the convergent and discriminant patterns (College Response has higher relations with these than Stigma) that support construct validity.

The \textbf{multitrait-multimethod matrix} is a systematic experimental design for the dual approach of convergent and discriminant validation, which requires the assessment of two or more traits (classically math, English, and reading scores) by two more methods (self, parent, and teacher). Conducting a web-based image search on this term will show a matrix of alpha coefficients and correlation coefficients that are interpreted in relationship to each other. Roughly:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  alpha (internal consistency) coefficients should be the highest,
\item
  validity coefficients (correlations of the same trait assessed by different methods) should be higher than correlations between different traits measured by different methods,
\item
  validity coefficients (correlations of the same trait assessed by different methods) should be higher than different traits measured by the same method.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{incremental-validity}{%
\subsection{Incremental Validity}\label{incremental-validity}}

\textbf{Incremental validity} is the increase in predictive validity attributable to the test. It indicates the contribution the test makes to the selection of individuals who will meet the minimum standards in criterion performance. There are different ways to assess this, one of the most common is to first enter known predictors and then see if the instrument-of-interest continues to account variance over-and-above those that are entered.

In the Szymanski and Bissonette \citeyearpar{szymanski_perceptions_2020} psychometric evaluation, the negative relations with satisfaction with college and intention to persist in college as well as intentions to persist in college and positive relations with both anxiety and depression persisted even after controlling for LGBTQ victimization experiences.

I will demonstrate this procedure, predicting the contribution that the LGBTQ Campus Climate total scale scrore has on predicting intention to persist incollege, over and above LGBTQ victimization.

The process is to use hierarchica linear regression. Two models are built. In the first mode (``PfV'' stands {[}in my mind{]} for ``Persistence from Victimization''), persistence is predicted from victimization. The second model adds the LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale. I asked for summaries of each model. Then the \emph{anova()} function compares the model.

In the PfVC model, we see that the LGBTQ Campus Climate full scale score has a significant impact on intentions to persist. Specifically, foreach additional point higher on the Campus Climate Score, intentions to persist decrease by .13 points. Together, the model accounts for 7\% of the variance (this is also an \(R^2\) change of 7\%).

This model is a little more exciting in that our first model (AfV) is statistically significant. That is, victimization has a statistically significant effect on anxiety, accounting for 5\% of the variance. Even so, when added, the LGBTQ Campus Climate total scale score is also significant, and accounts for an additional 4\% of variance (\(\Delta{R^2}\)),\(R^2\) = 0.85. There is a statistically significant difference between models (\emph{F}{[}1, 643{]} = 22.98, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).

\subsection{Considering the Individual and Social Consequences of Testing}\label{considering-the-individual-and-social-consequences-of-testing}}

Messick \citep{messick_consequences_2000} and others recommend that the ``consequences of testing'' be included in the concept of test validity. Messick's point was to consider the the unintended consequences of specific uses. That is, their use may be detrimental to individuals or to members of certain ethnic or other populations with diverse experiential backgrounds. Examples of inappropriate use have included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) being used as a screening tool for employment as a security job. Two of its items inquired about same-sex activities and the employer was using this to screen out gay men. Applicants were able to demonstrate, in court, a consistent rejection of gay applicants.
\item
  While this is not a psychological test, urine samples are often collected as drug screening tools. In reality, urine can reveal a number of things -- such as pregnancy.
\end{itemize}

The issue begs ``conflicting goals.'' In this case, the problem was not caused by the test. Rather, by its misuse. Studying the ``consequences'' of testing is one that is not necessarily answerable by empirical data/statistical analysis. It requires critical observation, human judgment, and systematic debate.

\hypertarget{factors-affecting-validity-coefficients}{%
\section{Factors Affecting Validity Coefficients}\label{factors-affecting-validity-coefficients}}

Keeping in mind that a \emph{validity coefficient} is merely the correlation between the test and some criteria, the same elements that impact the magnitude and significance of a correlation coefficient will similarly effect a validity coefficient.

\textbf{Nature of the group} A test that has high validity in predicting a particular criterion in one population, may have little or no validity in predicting the same criterion in another population. If a test is designed for use in diverse populations, information about the population generalizability should be reported in the technical manuals.

\textbf{Sample heterogeneity} Other things being equal, the wider the range of scores, the higher or lower will be the correlation.

\textbf{Pre-selection} Just like internal and external validity in a research design can be threatened by selection issues, pre-selection can also impact the validity coefficients ofa measure. For example, if we are evaluating a new test for job selection, we may select a group of newly hired employees. We plan to collect some measure of job performance at a later date. Our results may be limited by the criteria used to select the employees. Were they volunteers? Were they only those hired? Were they ALL of the applicants.

\textbf{Validity coefficients may change over time}. Consider the relationship betwen the college boards and grade point average at Yale University. Fifty years ago \(r_{xy} = .72\); today \(r_{xy} = .52\). Why? The nature of the student body has become more diverse (50 years ago, the student body was predominantly White, high SES, and male).

The \textbf{form of the relationship} matters. The Pearson R assumes the relationship between the predictor and criterion variables is linear, uniform, and homoschedastistic (equal variability throughout the range of a bivariate distribution). When the variability is unequal throughout the range of the distribution the relationship is heteroscedastic.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ReC_Psychometrics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-16}Illustration of heteroschedasticity}
\end{figure}

There could also be other factors involved in the relationship between the instrument and the criterion:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  curvilinearity
\item
  an undetected mechanism such as a moderator
\end{itemize}

Finally, what is our thresshold for acceptability?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider statistical signifance -- but also its limitations (e.g., power, Type I error, Type II error)
\item
  Consider the magnitude of the correlation; and also \(R^2\) (the proportion of variance accounted for)
\item
  Consider error.
  -The standard error o f the estimate shows the margin o error to be expected in the individuals predicted criterion score as the result of the imperfect validity of the instrument.
\end{itemize}

\[SE_{est} = SD_{y}\sqrt{1 - r_{xy}^{2}}\]
Where
\(r_{xy}^{2}\) is the square of the validity coefficient
\(SD_{y}\) is the standard deviation of the criterion scores

If the validity were perfect (\(r_{xy}^{2}\) = 1.00), the error of estimate would be 0.00.
If the validity were zero, the error of estimate would equal \(SD_{y}\).

Interpreting \(SE_{est}\)

If \(r_{xy}\) = .80, then \(\sqrt{1 - r_{xy}^{2}} = .60\)\\
Error is 60\% as large as it would be by chance.Stated another way, predicting an individual's criterion performance has a margin of error that is 40\% smaller than it would be by chance.

To obtain the \(SE_{est}\), we merely multiply by the \(SD_{y}\). This puts error in the metric of the criterion variable.

Your Turn
If \(r_{xy}\) = .25, then \(\sqrt{1 - r_{xy}^{2}} =\) ??\\
Make a statement about chance.
Make a statement about margin of error.

The focus of this lecture is the assessment of reliability. We start by defining \emph{classical test theory} and examing several forms of reliability. While the majority of our time is spent considering estimates of internal consistency, we also examine retest reliability and interrater reliability.

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The practice problems are the start of a larger project that spans multiple lessons. Therefore,if possible, please use a dataset that has item-level data for which there is a theorized total scale score as well as two or more subscales. With each of these options I encourage you to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Format (i.e., rescore if necessary) a dataset so that it is possible to calculates estimates of internal consistency
\item
  Calculate and report the alpha coefficient for a total scale scores and subscales (if the scale has them)
\item
  Calculate and report \(\omega_{t}\) and \(\omega_{h}\). With these two determine what proportion of the variance is due to all the factors, error, and \emph{g}.
\item
  Calculate total and subscale scores.
\item
  Describe other reliability estimates that would be appropriate for the measure you are evaluating.
\end{itemize}

I encourage you to use data that allows for the possibility of a total scale score as well as two or more subscales. This will allow you to continue using it in some of the lessons that follow.

\hypertarget{begins-with-classical-test-theory-ctt}{%
\subsection{Begins with Classical Test Theory (CTT)}\label{begins-with-classical-test-theory-ctt}}

CTT is based on Spearman's (1904) \emph{true-score model}, where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an observed score is conceived of as consisting of two components -- a true component and an error component
\item
  X = T + E

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    X = the fallible, observed/manifest score, obtained under ideal or perfect conditions of measurement (these conditions never exist);
  \item
    T = the true/latent score (that will likely remain unknown); and
  \item
    E = random error
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In CTT, we assume that the traits measured are constant and the errors random.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Therefore, the mean of measurement errors for any individual (upon numerous repeated testings) would be ????.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  That said, in CTT, the true score would be equal to the mean of the observed scores over an indefinite number of repeated measures.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Caveat: this is based on the assumption that when individuals are repeatedly measured, their true scores remain unchanged.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In classic test theory, true score can be estimated over multiple trials. However, if errors are systematically biased, the true score will remain unknown.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{why-are-we-concerned-with-reliability-error}{%
\subsection{Why are we concerned with reliability? Error}\label{why-are-we-concerned-with-reliability-error}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Measurements are imperfect and every observation has some unknown amount of error associated with it. Two components in error:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{random/unsystematic}: varies in unpredictable and inconsistent ways upon repeated measurements; sources are unknown
  \item
    \textbf{systematic}: recurs upon repeated measurements reflecting situational or individual effects that, theoretically, could be specified.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Correlations are attenuated from the true correlation if the observations contain error.
\item
  Knowing the reliability of an instruments allows us to

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    estimate the degree to which measured at one time and place with one instrument predict scores at another time and/or place and perhaps measured with a different instrument
  \item
    estimate the consistency of scores
  \item
    estimate ``\ldots the degree to which test scores are free from errors of measurement'' (APA, 1985, p.~19)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Figure 7.1a in Revelle's chapter illustrates the \emph{attentuation} of the correlation between the variables \emph{p} and \emph{q} as a function of reliabilty.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  circles (latent variables) represent the \emph{true score}
\item
  observed/measured/manifest variables are represented by squares and each has an associated error; not illustrated are the \emph{random} and \emph{systematic} components of error
\item
  a true score, is composed of a measured variable and its error
\item
  the relationship between the true scores would be stronger than the one between the measured variables
\item
  moving to 7.1b, the correlation between LV p and the observed '\,' can be estimated from the correlation of p' with a parallel test (this is the reliability piece)
\end{itemize}

Figure 7.2 in Revelle's Chapter 7 \citeyearpar{revelle_introduction_nodate} illustrates the conceptual effect of reliability on the estimation of a true score.

\hypertarget{the-reliability-coefficient}{%
\subsection{The Reliability Coefficient}\label{the-reliability-coefficient}}

The symbol for reliability, \(r_{xx}\), sums up the big-picture definition: that reliability is the correlation of a measure with itself. There are a number of ways to think about it:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a ``theoretical validity'' of a measure because it refers to a relationship between observed scores and scores on a latent variable or construct,
\item
  represents the fraction of an observed score variance that is not error,
\item
  ranges from 0-1

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    1, when all observed variance is due to true-score variance; there are no random errors,
  \item
    0, when all observed variance is due to random errors of measurement,
  \end{itemize}
\item
  represents the squared correlation between observed scores and true scores,
\item
  the ratio between true-score variance and observed score variance (for a formulaic rendition see \citep{pedhazur_measurement_1991}),
\end{itemize}

\[r_{xt}^{2}=r_{xx} =\frac{\sigma_{2}^{t}}{\sigma_{2}^{x}}\]
where
\(r_{xt}^{2}\) is the proportion of variance between observed scores (\emph{t} + \emph{e}) and true scores (\emph{t}); its square root is the correlation

\(r_{xx}\) is the reliability of a measure

\({\sigma_{2}^{t}}\) is the variance of true scores

\(sigma_{2}^{x}\) is the variance of observed scores

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The reliability coefficient is interpreted as the proportion of systematic variance in the observed score.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    .8 means that 80\% of the variance of the observed scores is systematic;
  \item
    .2 (e.g., 1.00 - .8)is the proportion of variance due to random errors;
  \item
    the reliability coefficient is population specific.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

To restate the first portion of the formula: although reliability is expressed as a correlation between observed scores, it is also the ratio of reliable variance to total variance.

\hypertarget{research-vignette-2}{%
\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-2}}

The research vignette for this lesson is the development and psychometric evaluation of the Perceptions of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale \citeyearpar{szymanski_perceptions_2020}. The scale is six items with responses rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\emph{strongly disagree}) to 7 (\emph{strongly agree}). Higher scores indicate more negative perceptions of the LGBTQ campus climate Szymanski and Bissonette have suggested that the psychometric evaluation supports using the scale in its entirety or as subscales composed of the following items:

\item
  College response to LGBTQ students:

  \begin{itemize}

\item
  LGBTQ Stigma:

  \item
    Negative attitudes toward LGBTQ persons are openly expressed on my university/college campus. (negative)
  \item
    Heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and cissexism are visible on my university/college campus. (heterosexism)

If we look at the information about this particular scale, we recognize that the \emph{supportive} item is scaled in the opposite direction of the rest of the items. That is, a higher score on \emph{supportive} would indicate a positive perception of the campus climate for LGBTQ individuals, whereas higher scores on the remaining items indicate a more negative perception. Before moving forward, we must reverse score this item.

In doing this, I will briefly note that in this case I have given my variables one-word names that represent each item. Many researchers (including myself) will often give variable names that are alpha numerical: LGBTQ1, LGBTQ2, LGBTQ\emph{n}. Either is acceptable. In the psychometric case, the one-word names may be useful shortcuts as one begins to understand the inter-item relations.

In reverse-scoring the \emph{supportive} item, I will rename it ``unsupportive'' as an indication of its reversed direction.

\section{The Big Parade of Reliability Coefficients}\label{the-big-parade-of-reliability-coefficients}}

While I cluster the reliability coefficients into large groups, please understand that these are somewhat overlapping.

Table 1 in Revelle and Condon's \citeyearpar{revelle_reliability_2019-1} article provides a summary of of the type of reliability tested, the findings, and the function used in the \emph{psych} package.

\hypertarget{reliability-options-for-a-single-administration}{%
\subsection{Reliability Options for a Single Administration}\label{reliability-options-for-a-single-administration}}

If reliability is defined as the correlation between a test and a test just like it, how do we estimate the reliability of a single test, given only one time \citep{revelle_william_reliability_nodate}? It may help to keep in mind that reliability is the ratio of true score variance to test score variance (or 1 - the ratio of error variance). Thus, the goal is to estimate the amount of error variance in the test. In this case we can investigate:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a correlation between two random parts of the test
\item
  internal consistency
\item
  the internal structure of the test
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{split-half-reliability}{%
\subsection{Split half reliability}\label{split-half-reliability}}

\emph{Split half reliability} is splitting a test into two random halves, correlating the two halves, and adjusting the correlation with the \emph{Spearman-Brown} prophecy formula. Abundant formulaic detail in Revelle's Chapter 7/Reliability \citeyearpar{revelle_william_personality_nodate}.

An important question to split half is ``How to split?'' Revelle terms it a ``combinatorially difficult problem.'' There are 126 possible splits for a 10 item scale, 6,345 possible splits for a 16 item scale, and over 4.5 billion for a 36 item scale! The \emph{psych} package's \emph{splitHalf()} function will try all possible splits for scales of up to 16 items, then sample 10,000 splits for scales longer than that.

Results of the split-half can provide some indication of whether not the scale is unidimensional.

In this case the maximum reliability coefficient is .78, the average .64, and the lowest is .04. Similarly we can look at the quantiles: .17, .71, .78.

The split-half output also includes the classic Cronbach's (1951) alpha coefficient (.64; aka Guttman lambda 3) and average interitem correlations (.23). The figure plots the frequencies of the reliability coefficient values.

While I did not find guidelines on what constitutes a ``high enough lowerbound'' to establish homogeneity, Revelle suggested that a scale with .85, 80, and .65 had ``strong evidence for a relatively homogeneous scale.'' When the values were .81, .73, .42, Revelle indicated that there was ``strong evidence for non-homogeneity'' \citep[p.~11]{revelle_reliability_2019}. In making this declaration Revelle was also looking at the strength of the inter-item correlation and for a rather tight, bell-shaped distribution, at the higher (\textgreater{} .73) end of the figure.

What happens when we examine the split-half estimates of the subscales? With only three items, there's not much of a split and so the associated histogram will not be helpful.

The maximum, average, and minimum split half reliabilities were .75, .96, and .70; quantiles were at .70, .72, and .75. The average interitem correlation was .56.

Because the alpha coefficient can be defined as the ``average of all possible split-half coefficients'' for the groups tested, it is common for researchers to not provide split half results in their papers. This is true for our research vignette. I continue to teach the split half because it can be a stepstone in the conceptualization of internal consistency as anestimate of reliability.

\hypertarget{from-alpha}{%
\subsection{From alpha}\label{from-alpha}}

The most common methods to assess internal consistency are the \emph{KR20} (for dichotomous items) and \(\alpha\) (for Likert scaling); alpha has an alias, \(\lambda _{3}\) (the Guttman lambda 3).

Alpha and the Guttman 3 (used for scales with Likert-type scaling) may be thought of as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a function of the number of items and the average correlation between the items
\item
  the correlation of a test with a non-existent test just like it
\item
  average of all possible split-half coefficients for the groups tested
\end{itemize}

Although the \emph{psych} package has an incredible and thorough \emph{alpha()} function, Revelle is not a fan of alpha. In fact, his alpha function reports a 95\% CI around alpha as well as bootstrapped alpha results.

Let's grab alpha coefficients for our total and subscales.

\end{itemize}

The documentation for this package is incredible. Scroll to near the bottom of the \emph{alpha()} function to learn what these are.

Especially useful are item-level statistics:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{r.drop} is the corrected item-total correlation (\protect\hyperlink{ItemAnalSurvey}{in the next lesson}) for this item against the scale without this item
  *,\textbf{mean} and \textbf{sd} are the mean and standard deviation of each item, across all individuals.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{But don't get too excited} the popularity of alpha emerged when tools available for calculation were less sophisticated. Alpha can be misleading:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  alpha inflates, somewhat artificially, even when inter-item correlations are low.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a 14-item scale will have an alpha of at least .70 even if it has two orthogonal (i.e., unrelated) scales \citep{cortina_what_1993}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  alpha assumes a unidimensional factor structure,
\item
  the same alpha can be obtained for dramatically different underlying factor structures (see graphs in Revelle's Chapter 7)
\end{itemize}

The proper use of alpha requires the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{tau equivalence}, that is, equal covariances with the latent score represented by the test, and
\item
  \emph{unidimensionality}, equal factor loadings on the single factor of the test
\end{itemize}

When either of these is violated, alpha underestimates reliability and overestimates the fraction of test variance that is associated with the general variance in the test.

It is curious that the subscale estimates are stronger than the total scale estimates. This early evidence supports the two-scale solution.

Alpha and the split halves are \emph{internal consistency} estimates. Moving to \emph{model based} techniques allows us to take into consideration the factor structure of the scale. In the original article \citep{szymanski_perceptions_2020}, results were as follows. Note that the alphas are stronger than in our simulation.:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
Scale (\emph{n}) & Alpha & Inter-item correlation range & Average inter-item correlation \\
\midrule
\endhead
Total (6) & .85 & .27 to .66 & .49 \\
College Response (3) & .82 & .56 to .67 & .61 \\
Stigma (3) & .83 & .60 to .66 & .63 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

In the article, we can see the boost that alpha gets (.85) when the number of items is double, even though the average inter-item correlation is lower (.49)

\hypertarget{to-omega}{%
\subsection{to Omega}\label{to-omega}}

Assessing reliability with the \emph{omega} (\(\omega\)) statistics falls into a larger realm of \emph{composite reliability} where reliability is assessed from a ratio of the variability explained by the items compared with the total variance of the entire scale \citep{mcneish_thanks_2018}.Members of the omega family of reliability estimates come from factor exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA; structural equation modeling (SEM) factor analytic approaches. This lesson precedes the lessons on CFA and SEM. Therefore, my explanations and demonstrations will be somewhat brief. I intend to revisit omega output in the CFA and SEM lessons and encourage you to review this section now, then return to this section again after learning more about CFA and SEM.

In the context of \emph{psychometrics} it may be useful (albeit an oversimplification) to think of factors as scales/subscales where \emph{g} refers to the amount of variance in the \emph{general} factor (or total scale score) and subcales to be items that have something in common that is separate from what is \emph{g}.

Model based estimates examine the correlations or covariances of the items and decompose the test variance into that which is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  common to all items (\textbf{g}, a general factor),
\item
  specific to some items (\textbf{f}, orthogonal group factors), and
\item
  unique to each item (confounding \textbf{s} specific, and \textbf{e} error variance)
\end{itemize}

\(\omega\) is something of a shapeshifter. In the \emph{psych} package

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\omega_{t}\) represents the total reliability of the test (\(\omega_{t}\))

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In the \emph{psych} package, this is calculated from a bifactor model where there is one general \emph{g} factor (i.e., each item loads on the single general factor), one or more group factors (\emph{f}), and an item-specific factor (\emph{s}).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(\omega_{h}\) extracts a higher order factor from the correlation matrix of lower level factors, then applies the Schmid and Leiman (1957) transformation to find the general loadings on the original items. Stated another way, it is a measure o f the general factor saturation (\emph{g}; the amount of variance attributable to one comon factor). The subscript ``h'' acknowledges the hierarchical nature of the approach.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the \(\omega_{h}\) approach is exploratory and defined if there are three or more group factors (with only two group factors, the default is to assume they are equally important, hence the factor loadings of those subscales will be equal)
  \item
    Najera Catalan \citep{najera_catalan_reliability_2019} suggests that \(\omega_{h}\) is the best measure of reliability when dealing with multiple dimensions.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(\omega_{g}\) is an estimate that uses a bifactor solution via the SEM package \emph{lavaan} and tends to be a larger (because it forces all the cross loadings of lower level factors to be 0)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the \(\omega_{g}\) is confirmatory, requiring the specification of which variables load on each group factor
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Two commands in \emph{psych} get us the results:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{omega()} reports only the EFA solution
\item
  \emph{omegaSem()} reports both EFA and CFA solutions

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We will use the \emph{omegaSem()} function
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Note that in our specification, we indicate there are two factors. We do not tell it (anywhere!) what items belong to what factors (think, \emph{subscales}). One test will be to see if the items align with their respective factors.

There's a ton of output! How do we make sense of it?

First, our items aligned perfectly with their respective factors (subscales). That is, it would be problematic if the items switched factors.

Second, we can interpret our results. Like alpha, the omegas range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 represent good reliability \citep{najera_catalan_reliability_2019}. For unidimensional measures, * \(\omega_{t}\) values above 0.80 seem to be an indicator of good reliability. For multidimensional measures with well-defined dimensions we strive for \(\omega_{h}\) values above 0.65 (and \(\omega_{t}\) \textgreater{} 0.8). These recommendations are based on a Monte Carlo study that examined a host of reliability indicators and how their values corresponded with accurate predictions of poverty status. With this in mind, let's examine the output related to our simulated research vignette.

Let's examine the output in the lower portion where the values are ``from a confirmatory model using sem.''

Omega is a reliability estimate for factor analysis that represents the proportion of variance in the LGBTQ scale attributable to common variance, rather than error. The omega for the total reliability of the test (\(\omega_{t}\); which included the general factors and the subscale factors) was .73, meaning that 73\% of the variance in the total scale is due to the factors and 27\% (100\% - 73\%) is attributable to error.

Omega hierarchical (\(\omega_{h}\)) estimates are the proportion of variance in the LGBTQ score attributable to the general factor, which in effect treats the subscales as error. \(\omega_{h}\) for the the LGBTQ total scale was .37. A quick calculation with \(\omega_{h}\) (.37) and \(\omega_{t}\) (.73; .37/.73 = .50) lets us know that that 50\% of the reliable variance in the LGBTQ total scale is attributable to the general factor.

Amongst the output is the Cronbach's alpha coefficient (.62). Szymanski and Bissonette \citep{szymanski_perceptions_2020} did not report omega results; this may be because there were only two subfactors and/or they did not feel like a bifactor analysis would be appropriate.

  \(\omega_{(h)}\), \(\beta\), and the worst split half reliability are estimates of the amount of general factor variance in the test scores
\item
  in the case of low general factor saturation, the EFA based \(\omega_{(h)}\) is positively biased, so the CFA-based estimate, \(\omega_{(g)}\), should be used
\item
  \(\omega_{(t)}\) is the model based estimate of the greatest lower bound of the total reliability of the test; so is the best split half reliability
\end{itemize}

Revelle and Condon's \citep{revelle_reliability_2019} recommendations to researchers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  report at least two coefficients (e.g., \(\omega_{(h)}\) and \(\omega_{(t)}\)) and discuss why each is appropriate for the inference that is being made,
\item
  report more than ``just alpha'' unless you can demonstrate that the measure is tau equivalent and unidimensional
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test-retest of total scores}\label{test-retest-of-total-scores}}

The purpose of test-retest reliability is to understand the stability of the measure over time. With two time points, T1 and T2, the test-retest correlation is an unknown mixture of trait, state, and specific variance, and is a function of the length of time between two measures.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  With two time points we cannot distinguish between trait and state effects, that said

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    we would expect a high degree of stability of the retest is (relatively) immediate
  \end{itemize}
\item
  With three time points we can leverage some SEM tools to distinguish between trait and state components
\item
  A large test-retest correlation over a long period of time indicates temporal stability;

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    expected if we are assessing something trait like (e.g., cognitive ability, personality trait)
  \item
    not expected if we are assessing something state like (e.g., emotional state, mood)
  \item
    not expected if there was an intervention (or condition) and the T1 and T2 administrations are part of a pre- and post-test design.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There are some \emph{methodological} concerns about test-retest reliability. For example, owing to memory and learning effects, the average response time to a second administration of identical items is about 80\% the time of the first administration.

Szymanski and Bissonette \citeyearpar{szymanski_perceptions_2020} did not assess retest reliability. We can, though imagine how this might work. Let's imagine that both waves were taken in the same academic term, approximately two weeks apart.

First, I will simulate another dataset with slightly different factor loadings and means. While this simulation will be able to demonstrate the code necessary for the evaluation, my simulation did not create any any dependency/link between the cases in Time 1 and Time 2. With randomly simulated data, we can expect there to be a low correlation between T1 and T2.

Although I won't demonstrate it here, we would also want to recheck the internal consistency cofficients we used for the reliability analysis.

With both sets of data we need to create scores for the total scale score and the two subscales. We also need to merge the two datasets into a single dataframe. We could do either, first. I think I will create the scale scores in each df, separately.

In our simulation, we have no missing data. Using an available information approach (AIA; \citep{parent_handling_2013}) where is common to allow 20-25\% missingness, we might allow the total scale score to calculate if there is 1 variable missing; but none for the subscale scores.

We would need to repeat this process with our retest (T2) data. In order for us to get sensible answers, I went ahead and simulated a new dataset with total and subscale scores for our variables for both waves. This next script is simply that simulation (i.e., you can skip over it).

Examing our df, we can see the ID variable and the three sets of scores for each wave of analysis. Now we simply ask for their correlations. There are a number of ways to do this, the \emph{apaTables} package can do the calculations and pop it into a manuscript-ready table.

We won't want the ID variable to be in the table.

\subsection{Test Retest Recap}\label{test-retest-recap}}

Here are some summary notions for retest reliability.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  increases in the interval will lower the reliability coefficient
\item
  an experimental intervention that is designed to impact the retest assessment will lower the reliability coefficient
\item
  state measures will have lower retest coefficients than trait measures
\item
  and those all interact with each other
\end{itemize}

Note: there are numerous demonstrations in the Revelle and Condon \citetext{\citeyear{revelle_reliability_2019}; \citeyear{revelle_reliability_2019-1}} materials (Table 1). In addition to the myriad of vignettes used to illustrate foci on state, trait, items, whole scale, etc., there were demos on duplicated items, assessing for consistency, and parallel/alternate forms.

If you are asking, ``Hey, is parallel/alternate forms really a variant of test retest?'' Great question! In fact, split-half could be seen as test-retest\ldots{} once you get in the weeds, the distinctions become less clear.

\subsection{Cohen's kappa}\label{cohens-kappa}}

Cohen's kappa coefficient is used to calculate proportions of agreement corrected for chance. This type of analysis occurs in research designs where there is some kind of (usually) categorical designation of a response. I don't have a research vignette for this. In the past, I was involved in research where members of the research team coded counselor utterances according to Hill's \emph{helping skills} system designed by Clara Hill \citep{hill_helping_2020}. In the helping skills system, 15 different helping skills are divided into three larger groups that generally reflect the counseling trajectory: \emph{exploration}, \emph{insight}, \emph{action.} One of our analyses divided counselor utterances into these categories. Let's look at a fabricated (not based on any real data) simulation where four raters each evaluated 12 counselor utterances (that represent the arch of a nonsensically speedy counseling session).

Historically, kappa could only be calculated for 2 raters at a time. Presently, though, it appears there can be any number of raters and the average agreement is reported.

Let's take a look at the data, then run the analysis, and interpret the results.

Kappa can range from -1.00 to 1.00.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  K = .00 indicates that the observed agreement is exactly equal to the agreement that could be observed by chance.
\item
  Negative kappa indicates that observed kappa is less than the expected chance agreement.
\item
  K = 1.00 equals perfect agreement between judges.
\end{itemize}

On using kappa:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  research teams set a standard (maybe .85) and ``train up'' until kappa is achieved

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    then periodically reassess and retrain
  \end{itemize}
\item
  really difficult to obtain an adequate kappa level when the number of categories achieve

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    example is Hill's \emph{Helping Skills System} when all 15 categories (not just the big three) are used
  \end{itemize}
\item
  really difficult to obtain an adequate kappa when \emph{infrequent} categories (e.g., ``insight'') exist
\end{itemize}

Our kappa of .35 indicates that this rating team has a 35\% chance of agreement, corrected for by chance. This is substantially below the standard. Let's imagine that the team spends time with their dictionaries, examines common errors, and makes some decision rules.

\end{verbatim}

In the output, reliability for a single judge \(ICC_1\) is the ratio of person variance to total variance. Reliability for multiple judges \(ICC_1k\) adjusts the residual variance by the number of judges.

The ICC function reports six reliability coefficients: 3 for the case of single judges, 3 for the case of multiple judges. It also reports the results in terms of a traditional ANOVA as well as a mixed effects linear model, and CIs for each coefficient.

Like most correlation coefficients, the ICC ranges from 0 to 1.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An ICC close to 1 indicates high similarity between values from the same group.
\item
  An ICC close to zero means that values from the same group are not similar.

\hypertarget{corrections-for-attenuation}{%
\subsection{Corrections for attenuation}\label{corrections-for-attenuation}}

Circa 1904, Spearman created the reliability coeffient out of a need to adjust observed correlations between related constructs for the error of measurement in each construct. This is only appropriate if the measure is seen as the expected value of a single underlying construct. However, ``under the hood,'' SEM programs model the pattern of observed correlations in terms of a measurement (reliability) model as well as a structural (validity) model.

\hypertarget{predicting-true-scores-and-their-cis}{%
\subsection{Predicting true scores (and their CIs)}\label{predicting-true-scores-and-their-cis}}

True scores remain unknown and so the reliability coefficient is used in a couple of ways to estimate the true score (and the CI around that true score).

Take a quick look at the formula for predicting a true score and observe that the reliability coefficient is used within. It generally serves to nudge the observed score a bit closer to the mean: \(T'=(1-r_{xx})\bar{X}+r_{xx}X\)

The CI around that true score includes some estimate of standard error: \(CI_{95}=T'+/-z_{cv}(s_{e})\)

Whether that term is the standard error of estimate
\(s_{e}=s_{x}\sqrt{r_{xx}(1-r_{xx})}\); standard deviation of predicted true scores for a given observed score),

OR, the standard error of measurement (\(s_{m}=s_{x}\sqrt{(1-r_{xx})}\); an estimate of the amount of variation to be expected in test scores; aka, the standard deviation of the errors of measurement),

the reliability coefficient is also a player.

\emph{I can hear you asking} What is the difference between \(s_{e}\) and \(s_{m}\)?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Because \(r_{xx}\) is almost always a fraction, \(s_{e}\) is smaller than \(s_{m}\)
\item
  When the reliability is high, the two standard errors are fairly similar to each other.
\item
  Using \(s_{m}\) will result in wider confidence intervals.
\end{itemize}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The practice problems are the start of a larger project that spans multiple lessons. Therefore,if possible, please use a dataset that has item-level data for which there is a theorized total scale score as well as two or more subscales. With each of these options I encourage you to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Format (i.e., rescore if necessary) a dataset so that it is possible to calculates estimates of internal consistency
\item
  Calculate and report the alpha coefficient for a total scale scores and subscales (if the scale has them)
\item
  Calculate and report \(\omega_{t}\) and \(\omega_{h}\). With these two determine what proportion of the variance is due to all the factors, error, and \emph{g}.
\item
  Calculate total and subscale scores.
\item
  Describe other reliability estimates that would be appropriate for the measure you are evaluating.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-1}{%
\subsection{Problem \#1: Play around with this simulation.}\label{problem-1-play-around-with-this-simulation.-1}}

If evaluating internal consistency is new to you, copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results. Perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(210827)'' from 210827 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.

\subsection{Readings \& Resources}\label{readings-resources-4}}

Classic psychometric texts tend to not cover item analysis for achievement tests. And/or, they skip over these fundamentals and move straight to item response theory/Rasch modeling (IRT). After scouring the internet, I landed on these two resources as concise, accessible, summaries.

\section{Research Vignette}\label{research-vignette-3}}

This lesson's research vignette is from my own class. Especially in the early years of my teaching, I gave high(er) stakes mid-term and final exams. There were usually 40 (or so) multiple choice or true/false items, 2-3 applied problems or short essays, and 1 longer essay. Today's vignette are an array of exam items from a statistics exam that demonstrate the desirable and undesirable elements we want in objective items.

\hypertarget{item-analysis-in-the-educationalachievement-context}{%
\section{Item Analysis in the Educational/Achievement Context}\label{item-analysis-in-the-educationalachievement-context}}

Multiple choice, true/false, and other \emph{objectively} formatted/scored items are part-n-parcel to educational/achievement assessment. But how do we know if the items are performing the way they should? This lecture focuses on item analysis in the context of multiple choice and true/false items. Using these practices can help you identify what selection of items you'd like for your exams. These can be critical tools in helping you improve your ability to assess student performance.\\
In-so-doing, we walk through a bit of ``what we used to do,'' to current common practices, to a glimpse of our future. We owe much of this to rapid advances in technology.

\emph{Test banks} are instructor-created resources for developing/storing/protecting items for use in future exams. We create test banks when we carefully distribute/collect/protect items ``that work'' (from statistical perspective). Why would we want to do this?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Once a test is ``out'' it's out. Instructors can presume that resourceful students are using it to study; yet all students won't have equal access to it.
\item
  Developing ``good'' items takes a good deal of time; does the instructor want to redo this each term?
\item
  Should we be piloting \emph{all new items} on students each term and then having the debates about whether the item should be rescored?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Better is to introduce a proportion of new items each year and evaluate them for inclusion in the test bank; EPPP, SAT, GRE do this.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A challenge is providing students appropriate study tools -- old exams are favorites of students (but maybe there are other ways -- worksheets, Jeopardy).
\end{itemize}

The conceptual portions of this lecture, particularly the interpretation of the difficulty and discrimination statistics are based in Anastasi's work \citep{anastasi_psychological_1997}

\hypertarget{item-difficulty}{%
\section{Item Difficulty}\label{item-difficulty}}

\hypertarget{percent-passing}{%
\subsection{Percent passing}\label{percent-passing}}

\textbf{Item difficulty index} is the proportion of test takers who answer an item correctly. It is calculated by dividing the number of people who passed the item (e.g., 55) by the total number of people (e.g., 100).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If 55\% pass an item, we write \(p\) = .55
\item
  The easier the item; the larger the percentage will be.
\end{itemize}

What is an ideal pass rate (and this ``ideal'' is the \emph{statistical ideal} mostly for norm-referenced tests like the ACT, SAT, GRE)?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The closer the difficulty of an item approaches 1.00 or 0, the less differential information about test takers it contributes.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If, out of 100 people, 50 pass an item and 50 fail (\(p\) = .50)\ldots we have 50 X 50 or 2,500 paired comparisons or differential bits of information.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  How much information would we have for an item passed by:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    70\% of the people (70 * 30 = ???)
  \item
    90\% of the people (90 * 10 = ???)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  For maximum differentiation, one would choose all items at the .50 level (but hold up\ldots)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{several-factors-prevent-.50-from-being-the-ideal-difficulty-level}{%
\subsection{Several factors prevent .50 from being the ideal difficulty level}\label{several-factors-prevent-.50-from-being-the-ideal-difficulty-level}}

\textbf{Speeded tests} complicate the interpretation of item difficulty because items are usually of equivalent difficulty and there are so many that no one could complete them all. Thus later items should be considered to be more difficult -- but item difficulty is probably not the best assessment of item/scale quality.

\textbf{Guessing} the correct answer in true/false and multiple choice contexts interferes with the goal of \(p\) - .50. In a 1952 issue of \emph{Psychometrika}, Lord provided this guide for optimal \(p\) values based on the number of choices in the objective context:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}l@{}}
\toprule
Optimal \emph{p} values \\
\midrule
\endhead
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
Number of Choices & Optimal Mean Difficulty Level \\
\midrule
\endhead
2 (T/F) & 0.85 \\
3 & 0.77 \\
4 & 0.74 \\
5 & 0.69 \\
Constructed response essay & 0.5 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{The purpose} of the testing changes the ideal difficulty level.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the test is \emph{norm-referenced} (ACT, SAT, GRE), .50 is very useful.
\item
  If the test is mastery oriented, \(p\) values may be be as high as 0.90 since student performance is a function of repeated attempts with feedback.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Item intercorrelations} impacts interpretation of item difficulty.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The more homogeneous the test, the higher these intercorrelations will be. If all items were perfectly intercorrelated and all were of the .50 difficulty level:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the same 50 persons out of 100 would pass each item, that is,
  \item
    half of the test takers would obtain perfect scores; the other half zero scores
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Best to select items with a moderate spread of difficulty, but whose AVERAGE difficulty level of .50
\item
  The percentage of persons passing an item, expresses the item difficulty in terms of which statistical scale of measurement? (i.e., nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Because of this issue, we can correctly indicate the rank order or relative difficulty of the items
  \item
    However, we cannot infer that the difference in difficulty between Items 1 and 2 is equal to the difference between Items 2 and 3.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We can make an \emph{equal-interval inference} with the table of normal curve frequencies (i.e., translating the proportion to z-scores). Z-scores would be used as the units if an equal interval inference was required in the analysis. For example,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{p} = .84 is equal to -1 \emph{SD}
  \item
    \emph{p} = .16 is equal to +1 \emph{SD}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Seem a little upside down? Recall that we are calculating the percent passing and starting the count ``from the top.'' So a relatively easy item where 84\% passed, would have an standard deviation of -1.}

\hypertarget{item-discrimination}{%
\section{Item Discrimination}\label{item-discrimination}}

The degree to which an item differentiates correctly among test takers in the behavior that the test is designed to measure.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the \emph{criterion} can be internal or external to the test itself

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    under some conditions, the two approaches lead to opposite results because (a) items chosen to maximize the validity of the test tend to be the ones rejected on the basis of internal consistency, and (b) rejecting items with low correlations with the total score tends to homogenize the test (we are more likely to keep items with the highest average intercorrelations)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{internal} criteria serve to maximize internal consistency or homogeneity of the test, example:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    achievement test, where criteria is total score itself
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{external} criteria serve to maximize the validity of an external criterion, example:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a different assessment of the same ability being assessed
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{index-of-discrimination}{%
\subsection{Index of Discrimination}\label{index-of-discrimination}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Compare the proportion of cases that pass an item in contrasting criterion groups

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    upper (U) and lower (L) criterion groups are selected from the extremes of the distribution
  \item
    traditionally these groups are created from the 27\% from each of those sides of the distribution
  \end{itemize}
\item
  This \emph{index of discrimination (D)} can be expressed as a difference of raw frequencies (U - L), or (more conventionally) as the difference of percentages of those who scored it correctly in the upper 27\% and lower 27\% groups

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    when all members of the U group and none of the members of the L group pass, D = 100
  \item
    when all members of the L group and none of the members of the U group pass, D = 0
  \item
    optimum point at which these two conditions reach balance is with the upper and lower 27\%

If we wanted to hand-calculate the index of discrimination for Item \#5, we find that 3 people (100\%) in the upper group selected the correct answer and 3 people (100\%) in the lower group selected the correct answer: 3 - 3 = 0. If you prefer percentages: 100\% - 100\% = 0\%. This means there is no discrimination in performance of the upper and lower performing groupings.

Older scoring systems (e.g., Scantron) used to provide this information.

For Item \#11, 2 people (\textasciitilde66\%) from the upper group selected the correct answer, 1 person (\textasciitilde33\%) from the lower group selected the correct answer. Thus, the U-L was +1 (+33\%) and the item is working in the proper direction.

Hand calculation: Upper = 2 (66\%), Lower = 3 (100\%). Difference = -33\%. This item is upside down. This is different than the Scantron snip below because uppers and lowers were likely calculated on exam total that included subjectively scored items (essays; and I no longer have that data).

\section{\texorpdfstring{In the \emph{psych} Package}{In the psych Package}}\label{in-the-psych-package}}

Using the \emph{score.multiple.choice()} function in the \emph{psych} package. Documentation is pp.~85-86 in \url{http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf}

A multiple choice exam presumes that there is one correct response. We start with a dataset that records the students' responses. It \emph{appears} that the psych package requires these responses to be numerical (rather than A, B, C, D).

The first screen of output provides an alpha. In this context, \emph{alpha} should tell us the consistency of getting answers right or wrong. Technically, the alpha is reduced to a KR-20 (Kuder Richardson 20). We interpret it the same. Alpha is directly effected by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{interitem correlations} among the items: a large number of positive correlations between items increases alpha
\item
  test length: more items produce higher reliability (all things being equal)
\item
  test content: the more diverse/broad, the lower the reliability coefficient
\end{itemize}

In the context of the classroom, reliabilities above .70 are probably adequate and above .80 are good. Reliabilities below .60 suggest that items should be investigated and additional measures (tests, homework assignments) should be included in assigning grades.

Focus instead on the second screen of output.

\textbf{key} indicates which answer was correct.

\textbf{1, 2, 3, 4} (there would be as many as there are options in the multiple choice exam) provide a \emph{distractor analysis} by indicating the percentage of time that answer was chosen. For item 1, option 1 was correct, and it was chosen 92\% of the time. No individuals chose options 2 or 3. Option 4 was chosen 8\% of the time.

\textbf{miss} indicates how many times the item was skipped.

\emph{r} is a point-biserial correlation with a dichotomous correct/incorrect correlated with the continuously scaled total scale score. Positively scored items let us know that item is working in the proper direction\ldots the students who got the item correct, did better on the overall total score and vice versa.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  one of the best indicators of an items ability to \emph{discriminate} (hence, \textbf{item discrimination}) among the criterion assessed on the test
\item
  it is important to investigate those with values close to zero (no relation between item performance with overall test performance) and those with negative values (meaning that those who had the correct answer on the item were those who scored lower on the exam).
\end{itemize}

\emph{n} tells us how many participants completed the item (this would necessarily be the inverse of ``miss'').

\emph{mean} repeats the proportion of individuals who scored correctly; it would be the same as the percentage in the item keyed as the correct one. This is an indication of \textbf{item dificulty}.

\emph{sd} gives an indication of the variability around that mean

It is mportant to look at the \emph{r} and \emph{mean} columns, together to understand the degree of difficulty and how well each item is discriminating between performance levels.

\emph{skew} can provide an indication of ceiling and floor effects.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{id}{%
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.25in,height=2.08333in]{images/ItemAnalExam/skew.jpg}
\caption{Image of two graphs illustrating positive and negative skew}\label{id}
}
\end{figure}

If a score has a significant negative skew (long tail to the left), then there may be a piling up of items at the upper end of the scale. This would indicate an \emph{insufficient ceiling} and make it more difficult to discriminate among differences among the higher performers.

If a score has a significant positive skew (long tail to the right), then there may be a piling up of items at the low end, indicating an \emph{insufficient floor.} That is, it lacks the ability to discriminate between poorer performers.

How do you tell what is significant?

A general rule of thumb says that anything greater or less than 1.0 is significantly skewed. A formal z-test can be conducted this way: \(z_{skewness}= \frac{S-0}{SE_{skewness}}\)

In our exam dataset, -2.65 is the most extremely negatively skewed item and its \emph{se} = 0.08.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\SpecialCharTok{{-}}\FloatTok{2.65}\SpecialCharTok{/}\FloatTok{0.08}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] -33.125
\end{verbatim}

Considering that anything greater than +/- 1.96 is statistically significant\ldots it is safe to say that this item has an insufficient ceiling.

What about the items with -0.30 (\emph{se} = 0.15)

\end{verbatim}

This is not as extreme (and recall my \emph{N} = 12, so I should probably look up a critical \emph{t} value), but there is still some question about whether my exam items can discriminate among high performers.

Please note, because these distributions are \emph{dichotomous} (correct/incorrect) they will never be normally distributed, but, like the difficulty index, they give another glimpse of the ability to discriminate.

Before we look at the specific exam items and their output from the scoring function, let me introduce you to the features of the psych package that draw from \emph{item response theory} (IRT).

\hypertarget{a-mini-introduction-to-irt}{%
\subsection{A Mini-Introduction to IRT}\label{a-mini-introduction-to-irt}}

To recap -- at the instructional level, the combination of percent passing (mean) and point-biserial correlation (discrimination index) is status quo for evaluating/improving the items.

The \emph{psych} package draws from its IRT capacity to conduct distractor analysis. IRT models individual responses to items by estimating individual ability (theta) and item difficulty (diff) parameters.

In these graphs, theta is on the X axis. Theta is the standard unit of the IRT model that represents the level of the domain being measured. Like a z-score, a theta unit of ``1'' is the SD of the calibrated sample.

The pattern of responses to multiple choice ability items can show that some items have poor distractors. This may be done by using the the irt.responses function. A good distractor is one that is negatively related to ability.

As we look at each of the exam items, we will look at the psych input from the scoring function as well as use the \emph{results} objects to create the IRT graphs.

\section{Closing thoughts on developing measures in the education/achievement contest}\label{closing-thoughts-on-developing-measures-in-the-educationachievement-contest}}

Item analysis tends to be an assessment of \emph{reliability}. However, in the context of educational assessment and achievement exams, there are also \emph{validity} issues.

\textbf{Content validity} is concerned with whether or not the scale adequately represents the entirety of the \emph{domain} to be assessed.

In educational and achievement contexts, this is often accomplished with a \emph{table of specifications.}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/ItemAnalExam/SpecsTableNewBG.png}
\caption{Image of a table of specifications}
\end{figure}

Image source: \url{http://www.sfsu.edu/~testing/MCTEST/testconstruction.html} (no longer operational) Usage type: unknown.

This tool allows us to identify the instructional objectives (first column) to be covered on the exam and allows the instructor to map out how the item will be assessed (the next 3 columns represent the manner in which the objective will be assessed) and what proportion of item types/content are covered. Mapping an exam out this way helps us

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ensure proportionate domain coverage (not just writing ``easy'' objectives)
\item
  ensure this coverage is assessed in different ways (e.g., knowledge, comprehension, application)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    this model is very ``Blooms taxonomy of educational objectives'' from the 1950s. Since then, there are numerous categories of educational objectives. APA's model is KSAs (knowledge, skills, attitudes).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Takeaway message}: Together, mapping out exam coverage in a table of specifications PLUS item analysis (difficulty/discrimination) can be powerful tools in educational assessment.

\hypertarget{practice-problems-4}{%
\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-4}}

For this particular lesson, I think some of the most meaningful practice comes from multiple choice and true/false exams that occur in your life. If you are in a class, see if your instructor is willing to share item analysis information that they have received. Learning management systems like Canvas, automatically calculate these.

If you are an instructor, calculate and review item analysis data on your own items. Think about how you might improve items between exams and cconsider how the dificulty and discrimination capacity of the item changes.

\item
  Define the corrected item-total correlation and compare it to an item-total correlation.
\item
  List the preliminary steps essential for scale construction, beginning with item development.
\item
  Name the type(s) of psyhometric evaluation these anlayse address (e.g., reliability, validity).
\item
  Identify threats to the interpretation of item-total correlations and alpha coefficients.

\section{Intro to Item Analysis for Survey Development}\label{intro-to-item-analysis-for-survey-development}}

Item analysis can be used to decide which items to include and exclude from a scale or subscale. The goal is to select a set of items that yields a summary score (total or mean) that is strongly related to the construct identified and defined in the scale.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Item analysis is tricky because we usually cannot relate our items to a direct (external) measure of a construct to select our items.
\item
  Instead, we \emph{trust} (term used lightly) that the items we have chosen, together, represent the construct and we make decisions about the relative strength of each item's correlation to the total score.
\item
  This makes it imperative that we look to both statistics and our construct definition (e.g., how well does each item map onto the construct definition)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{motivating-example}{%
\section{Motivating Example}\label{motivating-example}}

This lesson will also use the research vignette that presented the development and psychometric evaluation of the Perceptios of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale \citep{szymanski_perceptions_2020}.

The scale is six items with responses rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\emph{strongly disagree}) to 7 (\emph{strongly agree}). Higher scores indicate more negative perceptions of the LGBTQ campus climate Szymanski and Bissonette have suggested that the psychometric evaluation supports using the scale in its entirety or as subscales composed of the following items:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  College response to LGBTQ students:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    My university/college is cold and uncaring toward LGBTQ students. (cold)
  \item
    My university/college is unresponsive to the needs of LGBTQ students. (unresponsive)
  \item
    My university/colleg provides a supportive environment for LGBTQ students. {[}un{]}supportive; must be reverse-scored
  \end{itemize}
\item
  LGBTQ Stigma:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Negative attitudes toward LGBTQ persons are openly expressed on my university/college campus. (negative)
  \item
    Heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and cissexism are visible on my university/college campus. (heterosexism)
  \item
    LGBTQ students are harassed on my university/college campus. (harassed)
  \end{itemize}

Although Szymanski and Bissonette report inter-item correlations, it does not appear that they used item analysis to guide their selection of items. In fact, it is not necessary to do so. I like to teach item analysis because I think it provides a conceptual grounding for future lessons on exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.

\hypertarget{steps-to-item-analysis}{%
\section{Steps to Item Analysis}\label{steps-to-item-analysis}}

If this is initial scale development, the researcher(s) are wise to write more items than needed so that there is flexibility in selecting items with optimal functioning. Szymaski and Bissonette \citeyearpar{szymanski_perceptions_2020} do this. Their article narrates how they began with 36 items, narrowed it to 24, and -- on the basis of subject matter expertise and peer review -- further narrowed it to 10. The reduction of additional items happened on the basis of exploratory factor analysis.

\hypertarget{step-i-corrected-item-total-correlations}{%
\subsection{Step I: Corrected item-total correlations**}\label{step-i-corrected-item-total-correlations}}

\emph{A within-scale version of convergent validity.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If needed, transform any items (i.e., reverse-coding) and calculate a total score.
\item
  Calculate \emph{corrected item-total correlations} by correlating each item to the total score LESS the item being evaluated.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    to the degree that the item total represents the construct of interest, the items should be strongly correlated with the corrected total score
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Make decisions about items and scales. For items that have low or negative correlations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    consider deletion
  \item
    consider revision (requires readministering the scale)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Each time an item is deleted, the process needs to be run again because it changes the total scale score.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In fact, it's a very iterative process. It could be that you ``add back'' a previously deleted item (once others are deleted) because with each deletion/addition the statistical construct definition is evolving.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In multidimensional scales, if the total scale score is ever used, researchers should conduct these separately for both the total scale score and the subscales scores.
\end{itemize}

There are reasons to not ``blindly follow the results of an item analysis'' \citep{green_using_2010}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Method factors} (aka \emph{method effects}) are common methods (e.g., negatively word items, common phrasing such as ``My supervisor tells me'' versus ``I receive feedback'') that are irrelevant to the characteristics or traits being measured -- yet when analyze they share variance \citep{chyung_evidencebased_2018}.
\item
  Adequacy of construct representation. That is, how broad is the construct and to what degree do the items represent the entire construct? If the construct is broad, but there may be a tendency to

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    write items on a particular, narrow, aspect of the construct, ignoring others
  \item
    one or more items to strongly correlate, tempting us to delete items that are not as strongly correlated (although they represent the construct)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This means we should think carefully and simultaneously about

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  statistical properties of the item and overall scale
\item
  construct definition
\item
  scale structure: unidimensional? multidimensional? hierarchical?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step II: Correlation of each subscale's items with other subscale totals}
\emph{A within-scale version of discriminant validity.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Calculate scale scores for each of the subscales of a measure.
\item
  Focusing on one subscale at a time, correlate each of the subscale's items with the total scores of all the other subscales.
\item
  Comparing to the results of Step I's corrected item-total process, each item should have stronger correlations with its own items (i.e., the corrected item-total correlation) than with the other subscale total scores.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{data-prep}{%
\subsection{Data Prep}\label{data-prep}}

Let's do the operational work to get all the pieces we need:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Reverse-code the \emph{supportive} variable
\item
  Raw data for each of the scales

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    total scale score
  \item
    campus response subscale
  \item
    stigma subscale
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Total scale scores for each of the three scales
\item
  A merged dataset with the raw data PLUS the three scores (total, problem, emotion)
\end{enumerate}

If we look at the information about this particular scale, we recognize that the \emph{supportive} item is scaled in the opposite direction of the rest of the items. That is, a higher score on \emph{supportive} would indicate a positive perception of the campus climate for LGBTQ individuals, whereas higher scores on the remaining items indicate a more negative perception. Before moving forward, we must reverse score this item.

In doing this, I will briefly note that in this case I have given my variables one-word names that represent each item. Many researchers (including myself) will often give variable names that are alpha numerical: LGBTQ1, LGBTQ2, LGBTQ\emph{n}. Either is acceptable. In the psychometric case, the one-word names may be useful shortcuts as one begins to understand the inter-item relations.

In reverse-scoring the \emph{supportive} item, I will rename it ``unsupportive'' as an indication of its reversed direction.

Next, we score the items.In our simulation, we have no missing data. Using an available information approach (AIA; \citep{parent_handling_2013}) where is common to allow 20-25\% missingness, we might allow the total scale score to calculate if there is 1 variable missing; but none for the subscale scores. The \emph{mean\_n()} function in the \emph{sjstats} packages is especially helpul for this.

Let's first ask, ``Is there support for this instrument as a unidimensional measure?'' To do that, we get an alpha for the whole scale score.

The easiest way to do this is apply the \emph{alpha()} function to a tiny df with the variables in that particular scale or subscale. Any variables should be pre-reversed.

Examining our list, the overall alpha is 0.64. Further, the average inter-item correlation (\emph{average\_r}) is .23.\\
\emph{And just hold up a minute, I thought you told us alpha was bad!}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  While it is less than ideal, we still use it all the time,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    keeping its relative value (does it increase/decrease, holding other things {[}like sample size{]} constant), and
  \item
    also looking at alpha alternatives (such as we obtained from the omega output)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Why alpha in this context? Its information about \emph{consistency} is essential. In evaluating a scale's reliability we do want to know if items (unidimensionally or across subscales) are responding consistently high/middle/low.
\end{itemize}

We take note of two columns:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{r.cor} is the correlation between the item and the total scale score WITH THIS ITEM INCLUDED. When our focus is on the contribution of a specific item, this information is not helpful since this column gets ``extra credit'' for the redundancy of the duplicated item.
\item
  \emph{r.drop} is the corrected item-total correlation. This is the better choice because it deletes the individual item being evaluated (eliminating the redundancy) prior to conducting the correlation.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Looking at the two columns, notice that the \emph{r.drop} correlations are lower. This is the more honest correlation of the item with the \emph{other} items.
  \item
    In item analysis, we look for items that have relatively high (assessing redundancy or duplication) of items and relatively low (indicating they are unlike the other items) values.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

If we thought an item was problematic, we could eliminate it and rerun the analysis. Because we are looking at a list of items that ``made the cut,'' we don't have any items that are concerningly high or low. For demonstration purposes, though, the corrected item-total correlation (\emph{r.drop}) of the \emph{unresponsive} variable was the lowest (.28). Let's re-run the analysis excluding this item.

Both alpha (.58) and the overall inter-item correlations (\emph{average\_r}; .22) decrease. This decrease in alpha is an example of how sample size can effect the result.

Examining item-level statistics, we do see greater variability (.15 to .55) in the corrected item-total correlations (\emph{r.drop}). What might this mean?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The item we dropped (\emph{unresponsive}) may be clustering with \emph{cold} and \emph{unsupportive} in a subordinate factor (think subscale).
\item
  Although item analysis is more of a tool in assessing reliability, the statistical information that \emph{unresponsive} provided may broaden the construct definition (definitions are a concern of \emph{validity}) of perceptions of campus climate such that it is necessary to ground/anchor \emph{cold} and \emph{unsupportive}.
\end{itemize}

Tentative conclusion: there is evidence that this is not a unidimensional measure.

We want the items to have higher correlations with each other (.48 to .61) than with the StigmaT1 scale (-.02 to .09) with all three items). These are uncharacteristically low and are influenced by the simulation of raw data from factor loadings and the authors' excellent work in developing, evaluating, and retaining items that reflect two distinct factors.

Let's examine the individual items from the Stigma scale with the College Response subscale score.

Again, the inter-item correlations are strong (.49 to .62) while their correlation with the College Response scale is 0.00

\section{Interpreting and Writing up the Results}\label{interpreting-and-writing-up-the-results}}

Tabling these results can be really useful to present them effectively. As is customary in APA style tables, when the item is in bold, the value represents its relationship with it's own factor. These values come from the corrected item-total (\emph{r.drop}) values where the item is singled out and correlated with the remaining items in its subscale.

Although I pitched this type of item-analysis as \emph{reliability}, to some degree it assesses within-scale \textbf{convergent and discriminant validity} because we can see the item relates more strongly to members of its own scale (higher correlation coefficients indicate \emph{convergence}) than to the subscale scores of the other scales. When this pattern occurs, we can argue that the items \emph{discriminate} well.

\textbf{Results}

Item analyses were conducted on the six items hypothesized to assess perceptions of campus climate for members of the LGBTQ community.To assess the within-scale convergent and discrimniant validity of the College Response and Stigma subscales, each item was correlated with its own scale (with the item removed) and with the other coping scale (see Table 1). In all cases, items were more highly correlated with their own scale than with the other scale. Coefficient alphas were .79, .79, and .64 for the College Response, Stigma, and total scale scores, respectively. We concluded that the within-scale convergent and iscriminant validity of this measure is strong.

For your consideration:
You are at your dissertation defeense. One of the measures the Cronbach's alpha is .45. A committee member asks, ``So why was the alpha coefficient so low?'' On the basis of what you have learned in this lesson, how do you respond?

\hypertarget{practice-problems-5}{%
\section{Practice Problems}\label{practice-problems-5}}

In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. For this lesson, please locate item-level data for a scale that has the potential for at least two subscales and a total scale score. Ideally, you selected such data for practice from the prior lesson. Then, please examine the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  produce alpha coefficients, average inter-item correlations, and corrected item-total correlations for the total and subscales, separately
\item
  produce correlations between the individual items of one subscale and the subscale scores of all other scales
\item
  draft an APA style results section with an accompanying table.
\end{itemize}

In my example there were only two subscales. If you have more, you will need to compare each subscale with all the others. For example, if you had three subscales: A, B, C, you would need to compare A/B, B/C, and A/C.

Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results.

If item analysis is new to you, copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results. Perhaps you just change the number in ``set.seed(210827)'' from 210827 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go.

The script below pulls live data directly from the ReCentering Psych Stats survey on Qualtrics. As described in the \href{https://lhbikos.github.io/ReC_MultivariateModeling/}{Scrubbing and Scoring chapters} of the ReCentering Psych Stats Multivariate Modeling volume, the Perceptions o the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale \citep{szymanski_perceptions_2020} was included (LGBTQ) and further adapted to assess perceptions of campus climate for Black students (BLst), non-Black students of color (nBSoC), international students (INTst), and students disabilities (wDIS). Consider conducting the analyses on one of these scales or merging them together and imagining subscales according to identity/group (LGBTQ, Black, non-Black, disability, international) or College Response and Stigma across the different groups.
